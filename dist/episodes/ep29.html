[00:00:00] 

[00:00:00] **Jason Hand:** Jumping into AI stuff again. I, we've been chatting about what we looked at over the weekend.

Yeah. You looked at a few things. I looked at a few things and we decided that what we wanted to talk about today was really just sharing a new model that is relatively new to the market. A lot of people were talking about it. We hadn't had a chance to really play with it. And yeah, so we just thought we'd explore a little bit and that model being Gemini 2.5 Pro which, and who released that?

From Google. Yes, sorry. 

[00:00:30] **Ryan MacLean:** Fair enough. 

[00:00:30] **Jason Hand:** And as of today, which is May 12th, that is a free model, which I thought is interesting for such a heavy, it's a research preview type of model. And I haven't really put it through its paces yet. Are you familiar with Gemini and 2.5? Have you played with it at all?

[00:00:47] **Ryan MacLean:** I have, yeah. I think I've got one. It's a shorter episode where I played around with it, but yeah I have played around with it quite a bit. The thing that I really liked about it for coding is that it, at least in, in my experience, had a million token context, and I think over the [00:01:00] weekend I had context caching that really helped.

When you're working with a big. Project. So for example, we were talking about the AI tools lab, so that's ai tools lab.com site. And as we add episodes, it's getting bigger and bigger. And I was running into issues with sonnet three point sevens context where I don't seem to have those issues with 2.5 pros.

So I don't know if it's the caching of the contents or the context window that's helping, but it's certainly. Yeah it's unlocked a whole bunch of more in development to bring it all together for me. So that's about all I've played with, to be honest. I haven't touched it for anything other than just coding.

[00:01:35] **Jason Hand:** Okay. Yeah, that's right. I do remember you said you had just tried it out really quickly to see, I think it was brand 

[00:01:40] **Ryan MacLean:** new at the time, and I didn't even know it was special about it. 

[00:01:42] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. Anyway, I thought we'd pull up the demo of that I put together to kinda show what Gemini 2.5 Pro can do.

Although, like I said, I kept it very basic. But let me share my screen just to give you a little bit of background on, on what this is. Ryan, are you familiar with a Lissajous figure? 

[00:01:58] **Ryan MacLean:** I feel like I've seen this in [00:02:00] high school, but that's a long time ago now. But yeah, no, not so much.

I recognize this this pattern that you're showing to me. Yeah, but that's about it. 

[00:02:09] **Jason Hand:** Okay, let's watch this video real quick 'cause and I think there should be some audio coming through as well. There is, in fact, yeah, this is, I saw this on Reddit over the weekend. I was just browsing Reddit, drinking coffee one morning and I.

I dunno, captivated by this. And it got me down a rabbit hole of course. Of what are these leases you figures? I've never, for some reason it just never really, it wasn't a word that I was familiar with. But then I think like you, I looked at it and I was like, oh yeah, I've seen stuff like this before.

I just didn't know what that, it was called that. Anyway, a fun little video demonstration here. And there's a few other videos and animated gifs that I came across on Reddit that, yeah, just again, got me thinking about. About these in general, and there's a bunch of I actually did a quick search. There's a bunch of other mathematical figures, mathematical like visual [00:03:00] stuff like this that you can create awesome too that I kinda wanna go explore. Oh wow. That is 

[00:03:05] **Ryan MacLean:** fantastic. 

[00:03:06] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. So anyway, and then if you've ever looked at in a oscilloscope, 

[00:03:09] **Ryan MacLean:** I have. Yeah. And it definitely does feel like an oscilloscope.

[00:03:14] **Jason Hand:** yeah. So anyway, what I thought I would do is. Since Gemini 2.5 Pro is currently free. 

I thought I'd just see if we could somehow reproduce one of those Lissajous figures as a demonstration, like in an animation. Just a simple HTML page. It 

[00:03:31] **Ryan MacLean:** seems like a good way to learn if you're trying to learn the physics of it.

[00:03:34] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I would've loved having something like this when I was going through, like math and science.

[00:03:39] **Ryan MacLean:** Oh. Absolutely on a TI-83 or something like that. I'm sure I've done something similar to this and had a really hard time with it. 

[00:03:45] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, exactly. So anyway, here's the prompt that I've given it.

You can see it says, 'Generate a single page, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS demonstration of a Lissajous figure as an animation, including several variables that the user can adjust. This web app should be simple enough to host as a [00:04:00] GitHub Page'. I haven't put it on GitHub Pages yet or made it a GitHub Page, but that was right, obviously what I was thinking, 

[00:04:05] **Ryan MacLean:** like static html is what we're getting at.

Yeah, 

[00:04:08] **Jason Hand:** There's nothing really fancy going on here, so we might as well put it someplace that people can play around with it if it's gonna work. So Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model and you can see here it's what it was doing, and we can even open this up to explore what it was thinking.

I will begin by designing the HTML structure. And there's some sliders and number inputs. Just then thinking through what to do with the CSS, how it's gonna draw the figure on the screen, the canvas of the screen, how to handle some of the animations. 

[00:04:43] **Ryan MacLean:** Ooh, here we go. The math part. 

[00:04:46] **Jason Hand:** Get into, yeah, getting into some of the fancy math that I definitely don't remember, but probably learned in high school and then.

After it's gone through, its thinking. We've got our output here, just basic HTML [00:05:00] with some

[00:05:00] **Ryan MacLean:** this feels like something I'd have to pay Wolfram for a Wolfram Alpha kind of thing. This is fantastic. 

[00:05:05] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. So it's not a super long output here in terms of file size. I'll just scroll down to the bottom here.

So anyway, pretty simple stuff. 

[00:05:15] **Ryan MacLean:** Open lines kind of thing. It doesn't look very long. 

[00:05:17] **Jason Hand:** No. Lemme see if I've got it open here in. In VS. Code. Okay, I'll look down. Here it is. 

[00:05:23] **Ryan MacLean:** Oh, not even 

[00:05:24] **Jason Hand:** 226 lines of code long. 

[00:05:25] **Ryan MacLean:** Fantastic. 

[00:05:26] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, pretty small. And the result of it is this here. 

[00:05:33] **Ryan MacLean:** That is really cool. And if you refresh this page says it start like this, or, let's see, no, some stuff like that.

Yeah. 

[00:05:42] **Jason Hand:** And then I think I gave it some data purple. Got yeah. 

[00:05:44] **Ryan MacLean:** Get some 

[00:05:44] **Jason Hand:** purple. Made the stroke of the line a little thicker here. 

[00:05:48] **Ryan MacLean:** I like this. I don't recall you asking for line width this or speed. That's cool. 

[00:05:52] **Jason Hand:** No, all I did was just request that there's some variables to adjust.

Including several variables that the user can adjust and [00:06:00] Yeah, I'm pretty impressed with this. 

[00:06:03] **Ryan MacLean:** Oh I didn't even realize amplitude figured enough. It was just frequency. Yeah. Oh, very cool. I. 

[00:06:11] **Jason Hand:** So anyway, math math and science and coding all coming together for Gemini 2.5.

[00:06:17] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. Teaching learning tool for sure.

And this model. So how fast was that to create something like this? How long did it take? 

[00:06:23] **Jason Hand:** It wasn't that slow. I think it was, we can run it again. Let's just doing it in a new one. 

[00:06:27] **Ryan MacLean:** Now it, it feels and it's still emergent, but it feels like people are starting to talk about tokens per second.

Is like the speed everyone's talking about. And I don't know how relative it is because it depends on the context. But I'm starting to wonder about whether speed matters or latency, how long it takes or something to get to you. It seems to be one of those things.

It's now one another metric that we're thinking about. 

[00:06:47] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. I've got a timer here on my phone, so I'm gonna, we'll see how long it, it takes to get us to a final result. 

[00:06:54] **Ryan MacLean:** This would take me days. Oh, is it ahead of me? Oh, it's already faster than me. It's just flying. [00:07:00] Now I wonder if that's because they're in preview, but this does seem awfully fast

because each of these lines, you've gotta have, that's a lot of tokens per line. wow. That was quick. 

[00:07:13] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. So we should 10 seconds. We'll have to throw, the code's done. It still. Oh, it's done. It's still outputting its explanation. Okay, gotcha. I had the code completed in under, in 29.6 seconds.

Phenomenal. And I guess we can, it's done that. Maybe just grab this code.

Let's see if this looks any different than our first version. 

[00:07:33] **Ryan MacLean:** It does look a bit different. Some of those variables look different. And then to run it, are you just using the so I, I learned a new trick, NPX space HTTP server. Are you are you on the Ruby side? The pearl side? How do you host a dedication email site?

[00:07:51] **Jason Hand:** In terms of having a web server to view it? 

[00:07:53] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. Just locally. 

[00:07:54] **Jason Hand:** Usually I like the Python web server, but, yep. Python, because this is [00:08:00] just. basic HTML. Oh, just 

[00:08:02] **Ryan MacLean:** open. Just open it. Fair enough. Yeah, we 

[00:08:03] **Jason Hand:** don't need it. We can just come in here. And I named that one. You gotta remember that. Yeah. 

[00:08:07] **Ryan MacLean:** It's built into the browser.

[00:08:08] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. So if there was more, if there was more complicated stuff going on, you'd have to do that, but Okay. Is a little different. Here's version two. It's not animated automatically, but ah. Oh, we can bring it to life. 

[00:08:24] **Ryan MacLean:** Wow. That's impressive. The speed, I think is the main thing, like that model not only had the reasoning, but it also had the code and at the end had that explanation.

So it was actually quite a bit going on. This is pretty cool. Yeah. Wow. I'm impressed. Gemini 2.5 Pro. Yeah. Free. It's hard to argue with free. 

[00:08:49] **Jason Hand:** It really is. Yeah. The other thing too, before we go, I wanna show you is that the bottom of, when you get your output down here in the code, right?

[00:08:58] **Ryan MacLean:** What do you do with this after you get it? So do you paste an [00:09:00] in cursor or what have you? Gotcha. 

[00:09:01] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. And lemme go over to the other the other one that we had going, 'cause I think it was a little easier to demonstrate, but the bottom of the code here, I had an option to view it in. There's a couple things.

We can export it to Docs, 

[00:09:14] **Ryan MacLean:** right? 

[00:09:16] **Jason Hand:** Put it into Gmail, put it into Replit. 

[00:09:18] **Ryan MacLean:** Interesting. 

[00:09:19] **Jason Hand:** And Docs opens up in Google Docs, which I have to say is probably the last place I'll ever open up my code. But maybe, I don't know. 

[00:09:31] **Ryan MacLean:** I've been through audits where this kind of thing is important, but that's the only thing I can think of.

[00:09:35] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. You can also put it into an email. Which again, maybe there's a use case there. I don't necessarily have one, and it's not like it's gonna be,

[00:09:46] **Ryan MacLean:** it's not like it's loading this live in your email. 

[00:09:48] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, I was gonna say emails have HTML these days, but not not display displayed html.

That's just not, that's not the way I'm gonna do it. Interesting. And then and then Replit, which I'm not gonna do. And then [00:10:00] there's some other things over here in terms of this 'Double Check Response'. And 'Listen', I'm not gonna do the 'Listen'. I guess we can try the double check, but I have a feeling it's just gonna.

Come back with 

[00:10:09] **Ryan MacLean:** I will say I do enjoy the the Google Notebook, LM style of voice or the voices that they have. I find when reading content, it's, I won't say enjoyable, but it's listenable, which is saying a lot for computer generated voices, especially when they're injecting ums and ahs. It's, the voice is quite good.

[00:10:27] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. 

[00:10:28] **Ryan MacLean:** Yep. 

[00:10:29] **Jason Hand:** Okay. That was really all I wanted to show today. That was awesome. We'll just do a quick introduction into Gemini 2.5 Pro, which is currently in preview, currently free. Currently pretty good with code pretty fast to first token according. Yeah. And a lot of context, right? Big context window and yeah.

So go check it out. 

[00:10:52] **Ryan MacLean:** Go try it out. Let us know what you think.
