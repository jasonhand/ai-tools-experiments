## 

Jason Hand and Ryan MacLean chat and demonstrate practical uses of Claude and Lovable in coming up with and building on ideas very quickly .. daily .. almost as a personal challenge. Jason shares his morning routine of using these tools almost as a "second brain" or notebook to capture fleeting ideas that come during his morning coffee time outdoors and how turning to tools like Claude or Lovable feels like using a butterfly net to capture ideas, storing them for later exploration, dissection, or problem-solving. They discuss their tendencies to juggle multiple projects simultaneously and the challenges that accompany keeping track of all those ideas without losing context. 

They highlight how AI allows them to quickly kickstart projects they might otherwise only conceptualize in traditional notepads or task managers. Jason details his personal approach of using free plans on Claude.ai and Lovable.dev, strategically working within usage limits as a daily challenge. This habit not only sparks creativity and idea capturing mechanism, but also aids him in solving real-life problems through simple applications he has built like [**"See Ya There"**](https://seeyathere.netlify.app/) and [**"Split Sumthin"**](https://color-coded-budget-buddy.lovable.app/) to help organize friend gatherings at bluegrass festivals or to split expenses with others, but without the hassle of logging into or registering for a service with his Gmail account. These problems shouldn't require a user to give up their personal information to solve a problem. 

Jason also points out how such accessible tools reduce initial complexity barriers, allowing him to rapidly prototype solutions that he can later refine or abandon based on effectivenessâ€”thus paralleling themes familiar in songwriting processes where ideas are synthesized before being fleshed out.

<TranscriptSection transcriptContent="[00:00:00] **Jason Hand:** I have this routine now. Pretty much every morning I wake up outside, drink a cup of coffee or two and read through my emails and different mailing lists and stuff that I'm on.

And occasionally I'll get like an idea. And I'll just immediately switch over to Claude, or, it's usually Claude, but something and. And then just like jam out, like a quick prompt and see if I can get something going as almost like a notebook for me. Like a placeholder. I might not be able to finish it right now in the next cup of coffee.

[00:00:28] **Ryan MacLean:** Oh yeah. You see you're touching on something that's a big thing for me. Are you using it kinda like Evernote? You've got a bunch of projects in the mix or what have you. 

[00:00:35] **Jason Hand:** I'm just using it as a second brain 'cause I don't trust my own love that you know, same. I. I don't mean that to sound like 

[00:00:42] **Ryan MacLean:** No, I hear you though.

If you're working on two or three projects, it's difficult to have the context in your head of the, a lot of 

[00:00:46] **Jason Hand:** ideas just, they come and go. Yeah. And it's just the truth. And I guess that at this point in my life, I've learned like my own little hacks to capture 'em, like butterfly net, it's oh, that's a good one.

I gotta get it. And I put 'em wherever I can that I know, I know where I'll find them. [00:01:00] And that's what these are, that's what these are turning into, at least when it comes to solving small little problems or doing something that like helps with a hobby. Or, which is like one of some of the stuff I've been working on right.

Or recently is the summer is here and it's its time to get out and go see your friends and do fun stuff on the weekends and absolutely. Music festivals and just all kinds of fun stuff. And, but unfortunately we all are busy people and we have families and things and it's hard to like schedule time together.

So it's a common problem. 

[00:01:32] **Ryan MacLean:** Now there's, before you show us the app I get a quick question, like, how long is this session for you? Because for me to code generally, and I'm talking about maybe pre 2020 brain, it, that's a two to five hour at least process. It takes a long time for me to get into I don't wanna say the zone, but get into the working area where I've got my docs on one screen.

It's got probably a command line and an open code editor that'll take me, maybe not two hours, it'll take me at least an hour. To get up to speed to where I was before. And then feel like I'm actually doing some work again. [00:02:00] How long does it take you? Because it feels five minutes for me now if I'm just opening up a, like a Claude session.

[00:02:05] **Jason Hand:** What I'm actually finding I'm doing unintentionally is I'm using like Claude's free plan. And I'm also been playing around with Lovable, but staying on their free plan. Of course there's limitations for both. Claude has like usage token window yeah. Limits that are they flex, based on like demand.

And you'll run out. Especially like I've started really I told you before we were recording, I, I started really enjoying Astro because we've migrated our site and like I'm learning Astro. So now like a lot of my projects, I want them to be Astro projects. Gotcha. 'cause it just gives me so much flexibility and so many things you can do with it.

And but that's a lot of code. It certainly can be. Yeah. Agreed. I'm running out of I'm basically burning through the free stuff that they give you, whether it's the token limits on Claude, i'm not able to get more than maybe five back and forth conversations. Or prompts and responses.

Which isn't all that different from Lovable. You get five and I've been treating it like a challenge. It's not often [00:03:00] it'll get a zero shot. A lot of times the app is functional, it'll do what you said, but it's not what I have in my mind yet.

But if I can get there in five, like I, have with Lovable or until I run out of tokens on Claude, and they'll give you more every five hours by the way. But, I don't know. That's kinda my morning challenge. It's like how I've started to like boot up in the morning. 

[00:03:19] **Ryan MacLean:** Is that like half hour of work or an hour of work?

Yeah. Sorry to put a number on it. 

[00:03:23] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, I would say it's probably half hour to 60 minutes or so, and I don't know, some of that's also mixed. I, IGI bounce back and forth between reading stuff and maybe even also like doing a little research on something I just learned about. It's usually no more than 90 minutes of total time.

[00:03:40] **Ryan MacLean:** That's amazing to me. I'm pulling out the soapbox here just a little bit. 'cause I feel like this to me is like, when I used to play video games, I would sit for, I don't know, it felt like 18 to 20 hours at a time. These days I might have 10 minutes for a video game. And the term for that is called game snacking.

And this feels to me like code snacking or dev snacking. I don't need to pin a term on it, but it does [00:04:00] feel like a different way of coding that feels it. It scratches that same itch but in a much shorter timeframe. And it feels can come back to it a lot easier than I used to be able to.

[00:04:08] **Jason Hand:** It does. And that itch is oh, I wonder if I can solve that problem that I now have. Yeah. And here's another problem I have, I like to go stand up paddle boarding. And there's a ton of really great bodies of water around for me to go, when I can. But the weather is like the main thing that depends on if it's good conditions.

You don't want it to be windy. Depending on if you're planning on being in the water's too cold. There's just stuff that you wanna know about. So I tried to build a little app that uses open , meteorological data that's out there and do that.

And it was just like that was a problem I was trying to solve in that moment. I wanted to go paddle boarding. I wasn't sure where I wanted to go and because I've done this enough times to know that I've got 90 minutes to spare, right? Lemme just see if I can solve this. In a fun way and learn something along the way.

And usually what happens is if it doesn't work, it's just a toss out, I just toss it back. 

[00:04:56] **Ryan MacLean:** Throwaway code, yeah. Whatever. 

[00:04:57] **Jason Hand:** Yep. And I learned, definitely learned something in [00:05:00] that time. And then, but if it turns out to be good or something's, I want to continue on this and I have the time to continue on it, whether it's immediately or later, I can then drop it into Cursor is what I've been doing Right.

So that's just turned into my workflow lately. Just get a bunch of ideas going and then ones that actually have some legs, I take 'em to the next level.

Or lately sharing them a little bit more with some others and just trying to get some feedback. 

[00:05:25] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. Yeah. So is your spitball approach primarily Lovable or Claude free? Is that, those are your tools that you start with. 

[00:05:31] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, right now it's Claude's probably my go-to where I reach first to just get that like I said, notepad type of thing, get something going.

But Lovable has been like, I would say. Definitely number two, but the thing that's fun about that there's this term that I had to look up because when I started trying to figure out what I wanted to build here, I knew that I didn't want to have a real big architecture. I don't want like a backend like database and yeah. Cloud [00:06:00] storage, I didn't really want that's not how much, how obsessed I am about solving my own problems.

And also, I don't know, lately I'm just so fed up with being tracked by all of the different tracking. I. 

[00:06:12] **Ryan MacLean:** I don't think you're alone. I'm seeing a renewed interest in, in, not using Facebook and not using a lot of the social media apps, but trying to figure out what we can get it done on your own.

[00:06:21] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. It just really, it bums me out every time I see. So a cool new tool that I, I want to go try and it, you have to sign in with an email address, right? And create profile and stuff. And I was like. You don't always need that. That's not always the functionality that you have to have just to get the job done.

And that's what I was trying to do here with this app is like I was saying it's summertime and there's things to do and people to see and I wanted to create something like, it's a calendar. Oh, this is cool, that thank you. That allows me to choose days that I'm gonna be, am I going to see the bear naked lady?

I know that man. Yeah. Maybe I'll say I am gonna see that. And the reason why it New Red Rocks is there, is I've got these custom calendars that I Oh, cool. Hold it to display so we can put the Red Rocks [00:07:00] calendars in there. The main ones I'm actually the most interested in is all the bluegrass festivals that happen in Colorado.

This will show those, and if I say I'm gonna be at this yes, I'm attending that and that, and then done. And I would go through and just make all my selections right. And actually I'm logged (in air quotes). As you in this, okay, so I just sat here and said I don't want to have this profile thing and user set up, but there is that kind of functionality.

It turns out you can do that in the URL. Gotcha. And I think we've known that, or I've known that forever, but I've never really set out to build something that operates that way. 

[00:07:31] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. I'm only in there using UTM codes and things like that so what else can you put in that? 'cause I love playing with UTM codes.

Somebody will send me a link and I'll change the referral or what have you, just to play around and see what they're doing. 

[00:07:41] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, there's, you're basically so what's weird is here I'll actually finish making my selections here. When you. Make all your selections and then you go into the results.

We can see all the days where, it's a good, it's a good day for you and I to get together. Both of us are available on June [00:08:00] 5th. And so I can then say, come in here and say let's get together for, dinner or something. And then hit create invite and that's gonna create a Google invite that you can put in your calendar.

But the real like way to share this around and get me and you to put on in our own stuff is you have to hit down on the calendar. And I'm gonna move this to where it's displayed everywhere. You just hit share. Okay. And this huge, so if I hit that, this huge pull up the notepad here.

Link. Oh, wow. Is what gets generated. Okay. So I don't know if you can see that, 

[00:08:33] **Ryan MacLean:** but I can Yeah. 

[00:08:34] **Jason Hand:** Make it a little bigger. So that's the URL, right? With all this encoded. Oh, I see what's 

[00:08:39] **Ryan MacLean:** going. So it's saying true for certain dates. I can parse this a bit. 

[00:08:42] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. encoded. So there's users, there's user Id name, there's Jason, and the dates that I've selected, it's not exactly human readable, but this is like the temporary database that we're basically handing back and forth.

And building on, if like I, I make some changes, I need to then create a new link and pass it [00:09:00] back to you, and that'll be up to date. And then if you make some changes, you'll have to pass it back to me. But we can bookmark these and save 'em, turn 'em into hyperlinks to actually create state almost.

You know what I mean? Like I could say my, what I, my selections last week were this URL, but my selections this week are this URL. So you can create like a re like a history, if you wanted. Great. Anyway, it just really got me thinking about all the ways that you could use this type of data storage.

And so this has been the app that I've been working on the most since we last got together. But then I put together this other one, which is related, but I did it on Lovable. You'll see that. I see that. Yeah. 

[00:09:35] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. But it looks the same. 

[00:09:37] **Jason Hand:** It I made it look the same. Okay. I told it like, let's use the styling even though it's over unLovable.

And one day I'll probably give it a real domain, but. Yeah. One of the other challenges, yeah, I think for me and my friend groups, and again, probably literally everybody, is when you're going doing fun stuff, sometimes you get together and you all chip in on expenses and you're trying to figure out later like how to split costs, or maybe you have a big dinner date and there's [00:10:00] 10 of you.

Splitting costs is just always a headache. So I, that was something else I wanted to, solve for Oh, I like that. APIs and IPAs. Yeah. Perfect. And then of course there's, I'm not gonna put my Vimo in, but there, if I did, you could then send me stuff. But there's tools. There's like SplitWise that could handle this.

There's Doodle.com which can handle like the calendar stuff, but again, I don't want to go log in and give them all my. Email information. Yeah, I think we were looking 

[00:10:28] **Ryan MacLean:** at Doodle the other day. It's changed hands a few times, so I worry about where that data's being used. Yeah. Is my thing. And then people in the US use, is it Cash App or Venmo that I think are splitting stuff.

But then as a Canadian, I don't use either of those. So this is, yeah, it's constantly a concern for me. 

[00:10:41] **Jason Hand:** Exactly. And now I'm gonna put this up. Already in, in GitHub, and so go. Just deploy this somewhere yourself, and you don't have to use those tools. 

[00:10:51] **Ryan MacLean:** Oh, that's 

[00:10:51] **Jason Hand:** cool. So anyway I was just kinda like making up numbers here, but put you in here and put myself in here.

You can also change the colors pretty much anything that you wanna change can be stored in the [00:11:00] URL and it's pretty fun. So yeah, I owe you $10.50 and we could say maybe there's one other person, maybe Rick was gonna join us or something. And then, so we're gonna actually split that three ways now.

So there's three people for two expenses. Now Rick just owes you 22 and me, Jason, or me a dollar. Gotcha. So if we 

[00:11:22] **Ryan MacLean:** had supper two nights in a row and I paid one night, you paid the other night kind of thing, this would definitely solve that. Yeah, exactly. And then if Rick came along for both and didn't pay anything sort of thing.

[00:11:31] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. If as long, assuming you like, just waited till the end to tally it all up. You just put in your stuff. And again, you can share this around, like I put in my amount and then I'll like text it to you and you put in your amount. Anyway, I just got, I told you the other day in chat I've become obsessed with trying to find other little apps.

I can make that, that do this, but. DASH is upon us in that, but 

[00:11:51] **Ryan MacLean:** yeah, our internal event is taking up a lot of time. I do wonder though, have you tried making these apps in multiple places or do you typically just use because you're using two different types here. I guess I'm [00:12:00] wondering about the rubric or how you, what that thought process is.

Or is it just you reach for the one that's closer and try it out and Yeah. And see how far you can go? 

[00:12:07] **Jason Hand:** I guess I was saying I usually start with. A Claude, right? But one thing that I did realize in this most recent session with Lovable, with this the Split Something app is, lemme get in here to, oh, it's down here.

Please forget that they're right down here. 

[00:12:23] **Ryan MacLean:** A paddle weather whisperer. I like these names. I can figure out what it's trying to do. Yeah, we can come back to 

[00:12:27] **Jason Hand:** that one. 

[00:12:27] **Ryan MacLean:** The self weather tracker. 

[00:12:30] **Jason Hand:** So the deal with this is, I told you that I started in Lovable, but you only get five wishes, so you can only do thing five times and then, but one of the neat things, I guess it's neat for me, at least in this situation, is that you can push it up into GitHub okay?

And just create a new repo. From right here. So I like that idea. 'cause if it's a, if I like where this is headed I do want to get it into GitHub pretty soon because from there I'm going to probably play with it in multiple places. So I hadn't really taken advantage of [00:13:00] that intentionally until now.

And as you can see over here on the left, once I put it up into GitHub, I then pulled it up into Cursor, started doing things over there and it. Automatically all I was doing was just making some read changes to the README initially, but it automatically noticed the changes in the repo. 

[00:13:18] **Ryan MacLean:** That's cool.

[00:13:19] **Jason Hand:** And I could then review the changes over here and see it. And then another thing observation here about this whole process is just because, I guess now I have a better understanding of how Lovable works. It's not going to just redeploy the app. Now that it's in GitHub and you've pushed code back in, there isn't some sort of automation, continuous, like CI/CD build.

That just happens, right? Then you still gotta come back into Lovable and then there'll be a, an option up there to, I think it's, I don't think it's Publish and it's like redeploy or re- something 

[00:13:51] **Ryan MacLean:** Refresh or something like that. Yeah. Okay. 

[00:13:52] **Jason Hand:** Exactly. 'cause no, it sees that the code has changed and at that point now it's deployed obviously onto Lovable infrastructure and the app and everything [00:14:00] will work through the URL, that's been the process for these few is I'll start in the cheap sections or, in the, in the free stuff if I like where it's headed, let's get it into GitHub. And then from there I usually bring it down into Cursor and if things are really not going the direction I want them to, I get out Claude Code and because it Gotcha.

It just seems to like. Read my mind and do exactly what I'm, I need it to, but I try not to always default to that. Like I, I like. Understanding all of them. 

[00:14:30] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. This feels like a rapid application development framework of some sort. Even though it, on your end, it might feel like you're cooking spaghetti and throwing it at the wall.

It's the fact that you can try different ideas this quickly and iterate that fast, even if you have to go to GitHub and then refresh a page. To me is a benefit because as someone who doesn't do front end, this would be me asking a team to do something, waiting a week or two, and then seeing what they come back with only to realize my actual architecture was wrong or the premise that I had come up with wrong or the [00:15:00] framework I was using or wrong that the idea was wrong.

There's something fundamentally wrong with my idea. Yeah. Not with their code, but like with the instructions I've given them 

[00:15:08] **Jason Hand:** and some of them like have been. They just they exposed to me how complex this might be. And I have to decide, do I want to go that right way? This sounds fun, but like I need to stay in this quick ideas, like just what are the little things that have been bugging me that I can just solve, and let's move on.

I'll save the complex ones for later when things have, evolved. And also I've run out of small problems. Okay. But at least I got 'em documented and I can come back to 'em. 

[00:15:41] **Ryan MacLean:** The other thing that sticks out to me is in a pre gen AI world, and let's say it's 2019 or maybe 2018. For me at least I might write the ideas down, but I definitely would not have done anything.

So I'd have a list of 20 ideas, maybe 30 at the end of a couple weeks of working [00:16:00] on something. And chances are I may have spitballed on one of them, maybe two. If that though, to be fair, 

[00:16:06] **Jason Hand:** yeah. I have to yeah. Acknowledge the privilege that I have to sit Yeah, exactly. Sit outside on my front porch and just drink coffee and, ideate and read and learn and build and then start my day kinda off like that way. And then I, and then I take. 

[00:16:20] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. The promise of remote work was on the beach with your, Mai Tai, what have you. Oh, that, stuff like I, listen I worked remote and that still wasn't a reality for me.

There was still stuff that you I needed a bit more access. This does feel like a. I don't wanna say lone wolf, but something that you can do solo pretty easily without too much interaction, and then go back to a team and say, Hey I played around with this on the weekend. It looks like there's a new feature in Astro version five called, I don't know, component collections or, so something like that.

I forget what they're called, but some collections that we can use as a result. Let's try that. Here's an example. Let's not use this, but here's an example that I got with Lovable or Bolt or Claude or what have you. That to me is [00:17:00] incredibly valuable because again, as someone who doesn't do a lot of front end it, it's amazing for me to be able to try that stuff out.

So I, I think what I was looking for is some sort of other methodologies so you're saying five tries is generally when you'll stop you'll try a different tool. It's not time-based. It's more about what can you get done for free with a couple iterations or up to five iterations.

Then you'll pick up either Claude Code or if it's really serious Cursor is what it sounds like, and then you'll work from there and get. Like a human in the loop and another person to give you your feedback and then settle the features. Does that encompass? Yeah, 

[00:17:29] **Jason Hand:** and you know what?

Now that you say that out loud, 

[00:17:34] **Ryan MacLean:** sorry to rationalize it, but this sounds awesome. I just need friends, I think is the only thing. So what I, 

[00:17:38] **Jason Hand:** what but what it is, basically what I'm doing is like exactly what I do with like songwriting. Oh yeah. Is gotta, when the. Look, we're not always in the right head space for things.

And so when you are, you gotta jump on it. And that's that's what I'm, that's what those 90 minutes or whatever, it's, yeah, it changes, but that's what that is for me. It's collection, it's creation and collection time. And I've figured out I can use that [00:18:00] as like just getting ideas to bubble up.

And then use the time that I have to see if I can make some sort of progress. And it's just a phased approach, like you have, I have a. A hundred ideas. I get 'em down to five. Yeah. From there I get 'em down to two and then we go, do, we do the next thing. And that the fact that we can all do that now.

Yeah. The. There's gonna be a lot of people solving their problems, which I think is awesome. Which 

[00:18:24] **Ryan MacLean:** brings me to my next question. This is ma may I've got a solution, but I dunno what you're doing, but my brain feels like it's a squirrel and I'll look the other way and something grabs my attention all the time, especially now that we're, ramping up to an internal conference.

I've got a little bit less time than usual. I'm babysitting some dogs, my own dogs, let's be honest. But if they got any health problems or something like that, I might be dealing with them for a second, then come back to the computer and traditionally like that. And one two minute change of not looking at something would mean when I came back it would take me about 15 minutes to ramp up to what I was like, maybe not that bad, maybe about five minutes.

These days though, it feels like I can just type continue and [00:19:00] continue on. That being said, there's sometimes when I change tools that I really miss not having that context from whatever chat session I had. Sometimes I'll copy that out and do I might say the prompt or the system prompt or what have you.

A-P-R-D-I think we talked about before. I've been using todos a lot these days, but how are you keeping that context between maybe different days or if you're handing off to a different person or a different tool? What does that look like for you? Because todo is my answer and I, I don't think it's the best, but that's all I've got right now.

[00:19:27] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. I think for these, I don't believe I'm using. To do. Let me, 

[00:19:34] **Ryan MacLean:** And for those listening, I'm literally just talking about like a todo markdown file with check boxes in it. This is as sophisticated as I've gotten at this point in time. 

[00:19:42] **Jason Hand:** I've got a Claude file.

Okay. Okay. Like a CLAUDE.md, because it had, I did bring it into Claude Code at some point. 

[00:19:49] **Ryan MacLean:** Okay. And does Claude Code do that by default? Having only played with it once? I didn't notice.

[00:19:53] **Jason Hand:** It's a good question. I don't remember if I act, if I prompted it to make this. Okay. I think it created, its on its own 'cause there's not a [00:20:00] lot here.

Interesting. I wanna say it probably, yeah I don't know if I remember exactly when that was created, but that's all I've gotten. Really in here, I do have a roadmap file that I like started that was gonna be like my to-do. 

[00:20:14] **Ryan MacLean:** That's a good one. Yeah. When you're thinking down the road for other features or what have you.

Okay. 

[00:20:18] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. And actually I did that, like the first version of it is here.

I do have, like I said, there, there's a CLAUDE.md file in here, but it's really small. I think it was created automatically. I don't remember asking it to do that. But my roadmap file is like my similar to, to do but really meant to be like feature requests. So the first version I had of this, I sent out to some folks.

They came back and told me, it'd be great if I could send it out to multiple groups of people and keep that somehow still straight. Like some are my like music friends and some are family and like, how do I like visually see that? At first I was like, I dunno if I can do that without having some sort of backend like state management.

And then the same with also getting granular down to the [00:21:00] time, like what specific time, not just what day. Yeah. But the more I was like thinking about it, I was like, I think it, it's just another. It's just another number, just another like variable to be stored in the URL. I don't know why we can't do that.

So I can actually check this off. I did that. And that's pretty much all I've done so far. I haven't gotten probably more than four hours total time into this. 

[00:21:23] **Ryan MacLean:** That's pretty good too. If you think about the actual amount of work that you've done versus the output that's. Yeah, that's actually pretty incredible.

I 

[00:21:29] **Jason Hand:** was really impressed with the you know what, I might actually be able to pull up the first one. It gave me the zero shot. Let's see. You can see all the stuff. Colorado su standup paddleboard location app. Oh I made a little wordle game. A bluegrass themed Wordle. You like 

[00:21:52] **Ryan MacLean:** Wordle? That's amazing.

I do, in fact, like Wordle I'm enamored in with the fact that you can resume your state by just opening the same [00:22:00] URL again. Yeah. I think is what I really likem. 

[00:22:02] **Jason Hand:** I've got a really nice what do you call it, telescope, like deep space telescope. Not deep space, but like a good telescope. Yeah. Yeah. And I wanted to see if I could.

Figure, find something, build something that helped me, choose which day and time I should go. Go look at stuff. Didn't make very far on that one.

[00:22:18] **Ryan MacLean:** I'm loving this list of ideas, like each one. So each session is a new idea. I guess one of my problems with Claude is that my brain is just all over the place, so I'll end up putting three or four ideas into the same thing and then it gets confused halfway through it.

We'll change my weather app into a translation app just 'cause of the way that I started talking to it. So I've gotta be careful to split that stuff out. But it looks like you've you've already learned that. 

[00:22:38] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. It is a good way to compartmentalize things. And you know me to go back, I completely forgot if the word wordle thing, and yeah, so that's another one. And it's actually, it works. So I gotta go back and kinda tinker with that. Very cool. But this was the first conversation I had. So let's see, make this a little bigger. Wanna build a web app to help me find dates where multiple people are available on the same day, [00:23:00] like doodle.com, but only the date, not the time is important.

Want users to see a counter view, select all the dates and. States blocked. The app will then show all the best options for dates where the most people are available. 

[00:23:12] **Ryan MacLean:** I gotta say, this is the worst project definition I've ever seen. This is a Jira ticket. You know what I mean? This is one of those ones where you're like, ah, it's that project manager.

Like really? 

[00:23:23] **Jason Hand:** Sometimes an idea is just, but that is 

[00:23:24] **Ryan MacLean:** fantastic. The fact that you can run with that and just a, like a natural human language way of speaking to a an engineer is phenomenal, right? You don't like, I need it done by Wednesday. It's a large t-shirt size. I, I realize you're also busy on these other things, but this is a priority two.

So please prioritize it. Okay. Appropriately. This is fantastic. It removes all that headache of overhead of dealing with an engineering team. At the same time, you can do this while doing other things like drinking your coffee. This phenomenal to me. 

[00:23:52] **Jason Hand:** It just 

[00:23:53] **Ryan MacLean:** helps me 

[00:23:53] **Jason Hand:** get some ideas, 

[00:23:54] **Ryan MacLean:** Even this first iteration that you're showing me here, I guess it says V two, but this looks pretty good.

[00:23:59] **Jason Hand:** It [00:24:00] does, yeah. Does what it. Is supposed to do that. This 

[00:24:03] **Ryan MacLean:** is a really good rapid application development tool, which a couple 

[00:24:06] **Jason Hand:** things here, and then we look at the results and yeah, that's all three people are available. That's phenomenal. So that's what it got like on shot one. 

[00:24:14] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

Or zero. This is great. The way that it can create React apps that are just in a sidebar and Claude I, I think is fantastic. Be it in, in, in web or desktop or even the iOS app. I've noticed is, it's actually pretty neat to me just to visualize the idea that I hadn't realized, oh, no, that's actually.

You know what, why would you do that? Like you, you don't need the times of the day. Actually what I need is the date. And then realizing that's your feature set and going back to the well to get more, that, that's fantastic. I think the key is that you can get that result out there quickly and then iterate the problem with me.

I guess I. Past me prior to 2022 would be that I just wouldn't get started. 'cause it was so hard to get started. Yeah. And now it's no, I can get started on five or six different things and then pick the best out of them instead of just sitting there worried about how much time this [00:25:00] gonna take and not doing anything or over planning.

That is really cool. I. 

[00:25:03] **Jason Hand:** I do not like to waste time. And finally, I feel like I'm not wasting time by just exploring something. There used to be so many different things I'd wanna do with raspberry pies and Oh, don't get me started. I 

[00:25:14] **Ryan MacLean:** got 12. Yeah. Don't get started. Absolutely. And I just, I 

[00:25:16] **Jason Hand:** know that I'll get I don't know, days in and realize this isn't working and.

And I have this like a dread, this like feeling that washes over me. I'm like, that was a waste of time. And I just out like that's time is like the one thing I do not waste.

[00:25:31] **Ryan MacLean:** That is really cool. Listen I learned a lot from your process. I've been using. Bolt a lot and Claude Desktop and ChatGPT to a lesser extent.

But those are the three sort of tools that I use. I will say every time I've used Lovable I get Lovable results. And I hate to say that 'cause it's funny, but it's absolutely true is that I do enjoy my time in that app and it feels if we're still voting with our wallet it's almost time to stop the Bolt subscription and maybe move over to the Lovable.

It is where I'm at, but I have paid for Claude and it [00:26:00] wasn't cheap. I do feel like I'm getting my money out of it, and that's. That's not just like Claude sonnet for coding as an API key, but also the actual chat app. I do like it. I do pay for ChatGPT, but I've noticed myself using it less and less primarily because I'm using Claude for coding and I get more value out of coding than I do talking to ChatGPT about random things.

It's not my search engine. It doesn't do that yet for me. I don't know if it does for you.

[00:26:25] **Jason Hand:** Occasionally I'll start there on some things, but yeah, it's not, that's not why I'm the same with you. Like most of the stuff I've been wanting to do lately is solve my own problems. And I don't want to just, yeah.

I could go use Doodle and I love Doodle. I've used it for years. That's what we've used. It's worked fine. I just wanted to make something else. It's a solvable problem that I can take care of myself now. Yeah. 

[00:26:44] **Ryan MacLean:** That solve your own problems, that citizen developer thing to me is very exciting.

That means like the amount of people who can code seems to have increased. I'm bringing down a bar. I think here I'm lowering the bar for more people to start coding because I know it's difficult to say what the total addressable market is for developers out [00:27:00] there, but I do feel like this is.

It feels like it's exponentially growing as a result of making these tools more accessible. 

[00:27:06] **Jason Hand:** Yep. More equitable. Just more 

[00:27:08] **Ryan MacLean:** totally agree. 

[00:27:09] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. That's probably about all the time we have to talk today, so that was awesome. 

[00:27:15] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. Thank you very much for showing us what you've been up to. 

[00:27:17] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. It's been fun.

Kind of, finding time. Usually, like I said in the morning to, to work on it. 'cause as soon as I close the iPad and go, go up to my office, it's been DASH. 

[00:27:26] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah, that's what happens this time of year. Yeah, for sure.

[00:27:28] **Jason Hand:** But I'm DASH is closing is, we're almost here, so a week away.

Once, once we get through that, then we can we have a lot of plans we wanna make with the, with this program and what we're doing here, so 

[00:27:37] **Ryan MacLean:** Absolutely. 

[00:27:38] **Jason Hand:** It'd be nice to be able to focus on that. And anyway, thanks Ryan and no thank you. That was awesome. We'll talk to you on the next one.

All right. Bye 

[00:27:46] **Ryan MacLean:** folks. "/>
