                            AI Tools Lab consists of 30-40 minute recorded technical demonstrations of hands-on (early or first) 
                            experiences with AI-related tooling for developers. Each episode explores different aspects of 
                            AI tools and their practical applications in software development.

                <h2>Why AI Tools Lab?</h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to help teams navigate the AI era by leading discussions, demos, and observations 
                    that are grounded in curiosity and honest experiences. By sharing these insights, we aim to 
                    be leaders, not laggers, through this technological transition.

                    What it means to be a developer is changing rapidly. Therefore, what it means to be a developer 
                    advocate is changing rapidly as well. Through AI Tools Lab, we explore these changes together.
