In this video, Jason Hand and Scott Gerring dive into the benefits and innovations surrounding coding tools like Tmux, Helix, and particularly Claude Code. Scott shares his journey of embracing new technologies that allow programmers to guide AI in developing complex projects such as ray tracing without manually altering the code. He explains how these tools can integrate seamlessly into a programmer's existing setup by utilizing terminal multiplexers like Tmux to enhance productivity.

Scott further elaborates on using Claude Code within his workflow, allowing for an automated yet structured approach where high-level prompts guide the AI's coding process. The emphasis is on the importance of creating a thorough conceptual framework before letting AI execute tasks autonomously. Using real-time interaction with these tools, Scott highlights their effectiveness in handling complex queries in large code bases while saving time and elevating project complexity with minimal human supervision.
