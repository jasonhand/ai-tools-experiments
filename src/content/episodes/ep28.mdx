summary: "What happens when you combine kernel-level programming with AI assistance? Scott Mabe takes Jason on a deep dive into eBPFâ€”the technology that lets you hook directly into the Linux kernel without crashing your entire system. From Datadog's production monitoring tools to cybersecurity student exercises, eBPF is quietly powering some of the most critical infrastructure on the planet. Watch Scott use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to build real eBPF programs that monitor sensitive system files, proving that even the most low-level systems programming can benefit from AI assistance. It's equal parts educational and slightly terrifying when you realize how much power these tools put at your fingertips."

In this session, Jason Hand and Scott Mabe delve into the intriguing world of eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and its integration with AI tools for learning and application development. The discussion begins with Scott explaining his approach to learning new technologies through experimentation, using eBPF as a case in point.

They explore how eBPF interacts intimately with the operating system kernel, allowing users significant control over hardware for tasks such as memory access and network management. The conversation touches on Datadog's use of eBPF for enhancing observability through Universal Service Monitoring, Cloud Network Monitoring, and security tools. Scott shares an anecdote about encouraging cybersecurity students to learn about eBPF by looking it up on their phones during events.

The dialogue transitions into a demonstration where Scott uses generative AI tools like ChatGPT to write a program monitoring changes to crucial Linux files like the shadow file, which is critical for user privilege configurations. Despite initial coding challenges resolved via GitHub Copilot, this process underscores the value of these AI tools in developing functional scripts swiftly without extensive manual research or coding expertise. Both participants acknowledge the iterative nature of using large language models across multiple platforms to achieve workable solutions while emphasizing that although not perfect initially, these technologies significantly expedite development processes by offering foundational code quickly.
