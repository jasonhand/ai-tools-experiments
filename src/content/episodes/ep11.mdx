summary: "In this episode, Jason and Ryan explore the freshly released Llama 4 model from Meta, which was just released over the weekend. They dive into its capabilities, testing it on Hugging Face, and discuss its groundbreaking 10+ million token context window. The conversation covers whether such a massive context window might eliminate the need for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and how it could simplify prompt engineering by allowing for more detailed system prompts and guardrails. They also explore two model comparison platforms—OpenRouter and LM Arena—which allow users to test and compare different AI models side by side. During their exploration, they discover a lesser-known model called LunarCall that surprisingly outperforms others on a specific test. This episode provides valuable insights into the rapidly evolving landscape of AI models and practical tools for comparing their performance."
