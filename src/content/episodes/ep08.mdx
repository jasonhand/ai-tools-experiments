summary: "In this episode, Jason continues his exploration of using AI tools for debugging code by focusing on his \"Ignite Karaoke\" project, a web application that displays random images for users to improvise presentations around. After successfully fixing the search functionality in his Vinyl Viewer application in the previous episode, Jason now tackles a layout issue in Ignite Karaoke where images display with excessive space at the top of the screen. Using Cursor with Claude, Jason analyzes the CSS positioning problem and implements a solution by adjusting the margin and z-index settings. He demonstrates how the AI quickly identifies the root cause and suggests precise changes to fix the layout issue. Throughout the episode, Jason highlights how AI-assisted debugging tools like Cursor can efficiently solve specific coding problems, saving developers time and frustration when dealing with CSS and layout challenges."
