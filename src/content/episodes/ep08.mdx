summary: "Round two of the CSS debugging chronicles! Jason returns to his Ignite Karaoke project for another battle with layout demons. This time, it's not just the mysterious gap at the top of images—it's a full-scale war against z-index conflicts that are making his buttons completely unclickable. Watch as he and Claude tag-team their way through overlapping elements, positioning nightmares, and the age-old question: 'Why does fixing one CSS property break three others?' It's like debugging inception—every solution reveals a deeper problem."
