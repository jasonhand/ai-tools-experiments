summary: "James Eastham demonstrates the power of remote MCP servers in serverless environments, showing how AWS Lambda provides the perfect platform for conversational AI interfaces. He walks through building a complete e-commerce application with MCP integration, from Express.js implementation to Claude Desktop configuration. The episode covers practical considerations including cost optimization, security authentication, and observability with Datadog tracing. Perfect for developers interested in building conversational interfaces that integrate with existing microservices architectures and understanding the trade-offs between traditional APIs and MCP-based solutions."
