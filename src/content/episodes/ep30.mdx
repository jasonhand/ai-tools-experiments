summary: "Whitney Lee's weekend 'vibe coding' session just escalated into building the engineering journal of the future. What started as casual experimentation with Cursor spiraled into creating an MCP server that automatically captures Git commits, AI conversations, and terminal commands to generate reflective journal entries. Watch someone with a Kubernetes background tackle app development for the first time in years, discovering that the real magic isn't just in the code—it's in creating systems that help you think about your thinking. Sometimes the best productivity hack is building the tool that documents your own learning journey."

In this in-depth conversation, Whitney Lee shares how a weekend of "vibe coding" with Cursor spiraled into building her own MCP (Model Context Protocol) server—designed to automate the creation of engineering journal entries from Git commits, AI chats, and terminal commands.

With a background in Kubernetes and platform engineering—but not recent app development—Whitney walks through the creative and technical decisions behind her playful demo app and the real problem it helped her solve: tracking her technical progress and decisions with context, clarity, and reflection.

She explores:

- Why she started with raw Cursor and deliberately held off on using MCP tools
- The specific challenges she encountered—like lack of memory, unclear documentation sourcing, and staying on task
- How tools like Taskmaster, Memory, and Context 7 helped address those issues
- Her vision for a journaling MCP server that automatically generates daily, weekly, and monthly summaries—complete with tone, milestones, terminal history, and reflections
- How she designed and validated the architecture using AI-driven dialogue, test-driven development, and zero-trust principles

This episode offers a real-world look at how AI tooling can support—not replace—human thinking, and how to shape those tools into something genuinely useful and sustainable.
