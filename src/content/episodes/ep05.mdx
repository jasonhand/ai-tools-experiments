summary: "In this second part of Jason's exploration of Claude Code, he continues building his feedback form application that sends data to Datadog. After encountering CORS issues in the previous episode, Jason shows how Claude Code helped him implement a Node.js proxy server solution to bypass these limitations. He walks through the deployment process on Netlify, explaining how to configure environment variables to securely store the Datadog API keys. Jason demonstrates the completed application, showing how the form collects user feedback and successfully transmits it to Datadog's logs API. He highlights how Claude Code significantly simplified the development process, allowing him to create a functional web application with back-end components despite having limited coding experience. The episode showcases the potential of AI-assisted development tools to make coding more accessible."
