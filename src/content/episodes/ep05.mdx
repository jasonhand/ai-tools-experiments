summary: "When your website looks like it was designed by a committee of caffeinated developers from different decades, it's time for an intervention. Jason tackles the chaos of inconsistent styling across his AI Tools Lab site, armed with nothing but Claude Code and a healthy dose of frustration with manual HTML editing. Watch as conversational commands transform into precise code changes, standardizing layouts, fixing navigation quirks, and adding proper chapter markers. It's like having a patient, tireless intern who actually knows CSS—and never complains about tedious tasks."
