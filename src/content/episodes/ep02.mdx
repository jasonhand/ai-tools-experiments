summary: "Your terminal and code editor are about to get a major AI upgrade. Jason and Ryan dive deep into two game-changing developer tools that are reshaping how we write and execute code. First up is Warp Terminal, which transforms the command line from a cryptic black box into an intelligent assistant that actually understands what you're trying to do. Then they explore Cursor, the AI-enhanced editor that doesn't just autocomplete—it refactors, documents, and explains your code like a knowledgeable pair programmer. Watch them tackle real Python code improvements, from PEP8 formatting to Datadog API integration, showing how AI can elevate your coding workflow without getting in the way."
