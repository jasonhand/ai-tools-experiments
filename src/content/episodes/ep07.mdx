Jason's Ignite Karaoke app has a glaring gap at the top of every image that's been driving him crazy, plus buttons that refuse to be clicked. Armed with Cursor and Claude, he dives into a classic CSS debugging adventure where fixing one problem creates three new ones. Watch as they navigate the treacherous waters of z-index conflicts, margin mishaps, and the delicate dance of making elements play nicely together. It's a masterclass in why CSS is both beautiful and maddening."
