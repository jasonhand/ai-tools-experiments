summary: "In this episode, Jason Hand explores how to use Cursor with Claude to diagnose and fix a bug in his weekend project \"Vinyl Viewer,\" a web application that displays his record collection. The application has a search functionality that correctly filters records but incorrectly displays record details when users click on search results. Jason demonstrates how Cursor with Claude quickly identifies the root cause: when filtering records, the application creates a filtered data array, but the click handler incorrectly references the original data array instead of the filtered data. After implementing Claude's suggested fix, Jason successfully resolves the bug that had persisted for ten months, enabling proper display of record details from search results."
