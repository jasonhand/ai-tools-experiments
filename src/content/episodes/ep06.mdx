summary: "Ever have that one bug that's been mocking you for months? Jason's Vinyl Viewer app has been serving up the wrong album details whenever someone clicks on search results—Frank Zappa fans were getting Taylor Swift instead. After ten months of digital musical chairs, Jason finally enlists Cursor and Claude to play detective. What they uncover is a classic case of array confusion: the search works perfectly, but the click handler is stuck in the past, referencing the original data instead of the filtered results. Watch a ten-month headache dissolve in minutes when AI meets persistent debugging."
