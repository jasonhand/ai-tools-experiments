summary: "In this episode, Ryan MacLean explores Windsurf, an AI-powered code editor similar to Cursor but with unique features and workflows. He demonstrates how to set up a new Python project, discusses different ways of working with AI coding assistants, and shows how to create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) to guide project development. Ryan highlights the importance of planning before coding, compares Cascade (Windsurf's base model) with Claude's models, and introduces Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an emerging standard for connecting AI tools with external services. Throughout the discussion, Jason and Ryan reflect on the rapidly evolving landscape of developer tools, the different ergonomics of various AI assistants, and strategies for getting the most productive results when building projects with AI assistance."
