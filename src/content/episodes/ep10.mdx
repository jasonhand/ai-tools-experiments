summary: "The AI code editor wars are heating up, and Windsurf just entered the ring with some interesting moves. Ryan takes this Cursor competitor for a test drive, discovering that different AI assistants have distinctly different \"personalities\" and workflows. From the importance of writing detailed Project Requirements Documents (they're like love letters to your AI coding partner) to the emerging Model Context Protocol that promises to connect AI tools to everything from Kubernetes to your coffee machine, this episode explores how the developer tooling landscape is evolving at breakneck speed. Plus, why your AI assistant might start forgetting things after 45 minutes of coding together."
