summary: "Fresh from NVIDIA's GTC conference where 25,000 developers gathered to see where AI is heading next, Jason and Ryan bring back field reports from the trenches of production AI. The conference buzz revealed a new worry keeping developers up at night: \"wallet attacks\"—competitors deliberately triggering your AI APIs to drain your budget. Between tales of robots learning to navigate warehouses and autonomous vehicles taking over highways, Jason showcases the fruits of his own AI-assisted labor: a complete website overhaul featuring a working feedback form, finally-fixed UI bugs, and search functionality that actually works. It's proof that while the world dreams of AI taking over, sometimes the real victory is just getting your CSS to behave."
