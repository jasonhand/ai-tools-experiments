It's like having a patient, tireless intern who actually knows CSSâ€”and never complains about tedious tasks.","src/content/episodes/ep05.mdx","95ea6a051e51bcd5","ep05.mdx","ep06",{"id":435,"data":437,"body":512,"filePath":513,"digest":514,"legacyId":515,"deferredRender":104},{"title":438,"description":439,"heroImg":440,"videoId":441,"episodeNumber":442,"date":19,"author":20,"participants":443,"tags":444,"takeaways":445,"resources":462,"jumpTo":472,"summary":512,"featured":54,"transcriptAvailable":104},"Using Cursor and Claude to Solve Record Search Bugs","Following the journey of using Claude Code to implement substantial changes to a personal website, from planning to execution and troubleshooting.","../images/thumbnails/ep06.png","OxHCfE1bFBs",6,[22],[25,290],[446,450,453,456,459],{"text":447,"tools":448},"Cursor with Claude can quickly identify and fix complex bugs in web applications",[134,449],"Claude",{"text":451,"tools":452},"The Vinyl Viewer bug occurred because the click handler used the original data array instead of the filtered array",[134,449],{"text":454,"tools":455},"Claude was able to diagnose the issue without requiring extensive prompting",[449],{"text":457,"tools":458},"Cursor provides a more integrated experience than standard chat interfaces for coding tasks",[134],{"text":460,"tools":461},"AI assistants can help debug code even on projects that haven't been maintained for months",[134,449],[463,464,468],{"name":134,"url":149,"description":150,"featured":54},{"name":465,"url":466,"description":467,"featured":54},"Vinyl Viewer GitHub Repository","https://github.com/jasonhand/vinyl-viewer","Source code for the vinyl record collection viewer application",{"name":469,"url":470,"description":471,"featured":54},"Vinyl Viewer Live Demo","https://jasonhand.github.io/vinyl-viewer/","Live demonstration of the vinyl record collection application",[473,476,480,484,488,492,496,500,504,508],{"title":474,"url":475,"timestamp":70},"Introduction to using Claude Code for website updates","https://youtu.be/OxHCfE1bFBs?t=0",{"title":477,"url":478,"timestamp":479},"Introducing the Vinyl Viewer weekend project","https://youtu.be/OxHCfE1bFBs?t=42","00:00:42",{"title":481,"url":482,"timestamp":483},"Discovering the search functionality bug with Frank Zappa records","https://youtu.be/OxHCfE1bFBs?t=118","00:01:58",{"title":485,"url":486,"timestamp":487},"Setting up the Cursor environment and connecting to the project","https://youtu.be/OxHCfE1bFBs?t=170","00:02:50",{"title":489,"url":490,"timestamp":491},"Describing the bug precisely to Claude","https://youtu.be/OxHCfE1bFBs?t=240","00:04:00",{"title":493,"url":494,"timestamp":495},"Sharing the index and script.js files with Claude","https://youtu.be/OxHCfE1bFBs?t=368","00:06:08",{"title":497,"url":498,"timestamp":499},"Claude identifies the filtered data array issue","https://youtu.be/OxHCfE1bFBs?t=429","00:07:09",{"title":501,"url":502,"timestamp":503},"Applying Claude's code fix to the script file","https://youtu.be/OxHCfE1bFBs?t=490","00:08:10",{"title":505,"url":506,"timestamp":507},"Investigating why the fix didn't work and making adjustments","https://youtu.be/OxHCfE1bFBs?t=782","00:13:02",{"title":509,"url":510,"timestamp":511},"Testing again with the new build and confirming the fix works","https://youtu.be/OxHCfE1bFBs?t=954","00:15:54","Ever have that one bug that's been mocking you for months?

Jason and Ryan tackle the growing problem of AI assistants that forget everything between sessions, exploring how Cursor Rules and detailed project docs are becoming the antidote to starting from scratch every time. They dive into Google's new Firebase Studioâ€”part code editor, part AI playgroundâ€”and compare it to the growing ecosystem of cloud-based development environments from Microsoft, Amazon, and others. It's a glimpse into a future where your development environment knows as much about your project as you do, assuming you can teach it to remember.","In this episode, Jason Hand and Ryan MacLean explore two key topics in AI development workflows: the importance of Cursor Rules in AI-powered IDEs and Google's new Firebase Studio. They begin with a recap of their previous discussion on LLAMA 4 and model comparison tools like LM Arena. The conversation then shifts to the critical role of Cursor Rules and project requirement documents in AI coding environments like Cursor and WindSurf, highlighting how these help combat \"AI amnesia\" by preserving context between sessions and reducing repetitive instructions. They discuss different approaches to maintaining context, including ChatGPT's memory features versus explicit Cursor Rules, and how developers are finding solutions to the \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" challenge when working with AI.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, they explore Firebase Studio, a newly announced cloud-based IDE from Google that integrates with Gemini models. They test its capabilities by importing an existing projectâ€”a simple dog breed viewer appâ€”and discuss the interface, API key management, and potential use cases. They compare Firebase Studio with similar offerings from Microsoft (Azure AI Studio) and Amazon (Bedrock Studio), noting that cloud providers are increasingly building their own AI-powered development environments. Throughout their exploration, they reflect on important considerations for developers, including security practices, the need for proper monitoring, and the balance between ease of use and deliberate planning in AI application development.","src/content/episodes/ep12.mdx","f1646a89d51bf603","ep12.mdx","ep13",{"id":1023,"data":1025,"body":1117,"filePath":1118,"digest":1119,"legacyId":1120,"deferredRender":104},{"title":1026,"description":1027,"heroImg":1028,"videoId":1029,"episodeNumber":1030,"date":19,"author":20,"participants":1031,"tags":1032,"takeaways":1035,"resources":1061,"jumpTo":1081,"summary":1116,"featured":54,"transcriptAvailable":104},"Exploring Bolt: Rapid App Development with AI-Powered Templates","Explore Bolt, an AI-powered development tool that enables rapid app creation through templates and natural language prompts, perfect for prototyping and concept visualization.","../images/thumbnails/ep13.png","hc-hKcoP3Pw",13,[22,23],[1033,1034],"bolt","ai-development",[1036,1039,1042,1048,1051,1054,1057],{"text":1037,"tools":1038},"Bolt provides a template-based approach to rapidly build web and mobile applications",[983],{"text":1040,"tools":1041},"It's particularly useful for prototyping and \"vibe coding\" - quickly visualizing concepts",[983],{"text":1043,"tools":1044},"The tool works with multiple frameworks including React, Next.js, and Expo",[983,1045,1046,1047],"React","Next.js","Expo",{"text":1049,"tools":1050},"Users can download their code and continue development in their preferred IDE",[983],{"text":1052,"tools":1053},"While it may not be ideal for production-grade applications, it excels at exploration and prototyping",[983],{"text":1055,"tools":1056},"Screenshot-based programming allows for quickly recreating interfaces from images",[983],{"text":1058,"tools":1059},"Bolt offers both hosted and open-source versions for different use cases",[983,1060],"Bolt DIY",[1062,1066,1070,1074,1078],{"name":1063,"url":1064,"description":1065,"featured":54},"Bolt Website","https://bolt.new","The hosted version of the Bolt AI-powered development tool",{"name":1067,"url":1068,"description":1069,"featured":54},"Bolt DIY (Open Source Version)","https://bolt.diy","Free offline version that can connect to various AI models",{"name":1071,"url":1072,"description":1073,"featured":54},"Expo Framework","https://expo.dev","Mobile app development framework supported by Bolt",{"name":1075,"url":1076,"description":1077,"featured":54},"Supabase","https://supabase.com","Database solution mentioned in the discussion",{"name":873,"url":1079,"description":1080,"featured":54},"https://openrouter.ai","Service for accessing various AI models",[1082,1085,1088,1092,1096,1099,1102,1105,1108,1112],{"title":1083,"url":1084,"timestamp":70},"Introduction and catching up on AI developments","https://youtu.be/hc-hKcoP3Pw?t=0",{"title":1086,"url":1087,"timestamp":897},"Reviewing previous conversations about AI coding tools","https://youtu.be/hc-hKcoP3Pw?t=60",{"title":1089,"url":1090,"timestamp":1091},"Exploring the AI-tools-lab.com website features","https://youtu.be/hc-hKcoP3Pw?t=128","00:02:08",{"title":1093,"url":1094,"timestamp":1095},"Introduction to Bolt and its template-based approach","https://youtu.be/hc-hKcoP3Pw?t=253","00:04:13",{"title":1097,"url":1098,"timestamp":162},"Building an app with Bolt using Astro framework","https://youtu.be/hc-hKcoP3Pw?t=360",{"title":1100,"url":1101,"timestamp":729},"Creating a Japanese translation app with Expo","https://youtu.be/hc-hKcoP3Pw?t=600",{"title":1103,"url":1104,"timestamp":174},"Troubleshooting API integration and translation features","https://youtu.be/hc-hKcoP3Pw?t=900",{"title":1106,"url":1107,"timestamp":182},"Demonstrating screenshot-based programming in Bolt","https://youtu.be/hc-hKcoP3Pw?t=1260",{"title":1109,"url":1110,"timestamp":1111},"Exploring deployment options and Netlify integration","https://youtu.be/hc-hKcoP3Pw?t=1470","00:24:30",{"title":1113,"url":1114,"timestamp":1115},"Discussion on security considerations for generated apps","https://youtu.be/hc-hKcoP3Pw?t=1710","00:28:30","\"Vibe coding\" might sound like tech bro nonsense, but Ryan's onto something with Boltâ€”a browser-based AI tool that turns half-formed ideas into working prototypes faster than you can explain them to a human developer.

Those days are officially over. Jason shows off Sora's latest party trick: creating professional thumbnails with actual readable text and proper typographyâ€”no more wonky letters that look like they survived a blender accident. But the real show starts when they fire up Lovable to build full-stack apps in real-time. Watch Jason attempt a travel notebook while Ryan crafts a weather dashboard, both racing against the cruel tyranny of free-tier limitations (spoiler: five interactions go fast when you're having this much fun). It's a masterclass in how AI tools have quietly crossed the line from \"impressive tech demo\" to \"actually useful.\"","In this episode, Jason Hand and Ryan MacLean explore recent developments in AI tools, focusing on image generation with Sora and app building with Lovable. They begin by discussing Jason's experience using Sora to create images for website thumbnails, noting the significant improvement in AI's ability to generate images with text. Both hosts are impressed by how Sora can now produce professional-looking fonts with proper kerning and layout, a capability that wasn't possible until recently. They examine various images Jason created, including Y2K aesthetic thumbnails and 3D cartoon renderings of cats, acknowledging that generative AI has reached a point where many outputs no longer trigger the 'AI slop' response they previously discussed. The conversation then shifts to Lovable, a full-stack development tool similar to Bolt (which they discussed in a previous episode). They explore Lovable's capabilities by building applications - Jason attempts to create a travel notebook app while Ryan builds a weather dashboard. Throughout their hands-on testing, they highlight Lovable's intuitive interface, error correction features, and ability to quickly generate functional applications with minimal input. They discuss limitations of the free tier (which offers only five interactions per day), the GitHub integration options, and how these tools might fit into a developer's workflow. The hosts conclude by reflecting on their evolving perspectives on generative AI tools, with Jason admitting he's warming up to some AI-generated content now that the quality has improved significantly, and both acknowledging Supabase as a valuable database solution that integrates well with these development tools.","src/content/episodes/ep15.mdx","77525631feec068f","ep15.mdx","ep16",{"id":1331,"data":1333,"body":1430,"filePath":1431,"digest":1432,"legacyId":1433,"deferredRender":104},{"title":1334,"description":1335,"heroImg":1336,"videoId":1337,"episodeNumber":1338,"date":1339,"author":20,"participants":1340,"tags":1341,"takeaways":1346,"resources":1365,"jumpTo":1385,"summary":1429,"featured":54,"transcriptAvailable":104},"Enhancing CSS Editing with LLMs: Using Puppeteer for Visual Context","Ryan demonstrates how to leverage Puppeteer's screenshot capabilities through MCP to provide visual context for LLMs, creating a virtuous cycle for CSS editing and design improvements.","../images/thumbnails/ep16.png","duMkcV7d_wo",16,"2025-04-30T00:00:00.000Z",[23],[1342,1343,1344,1345],"puppeteer","mcp","gemini","css",[1347,1352,1355,1358,1362],{"text":1348,"tools":1349},"Using visual context through screenshots helps LLMs make better CSS editing decisions than relying on text alone",[1350,1351],"Puppeteer","LLMs",{"text":1353,"tools":1354},"Puppeteer integration with LLMs creates a virtuous feedback cycle for quickly iterating on design changes",[1350,776],{"text":1356,"tools":1357},"The MCP (Model Control Protocol) server is essential for allowing LLMs to interact with local development environments",[776,1350],{"text":1359,"tools":1360},"Working in a test branch provides a safe environment for experimenting with AI-suggested CSS changes",[1361,534],"Git",{"text":1363,"tools":1364},"Despite requiring manual approval for screenshots, the workflow with Gemini 2.5 Pro is fast enough to create an efficient development experience",[959,1350],[1366,1369,1373,1377,1381],{"name":1350,"url":1367,"description":1368,"featured":54},"https://pptr.dev/","Headless browser automation library for taking screenshots of websites",{"name":1370,"url":1371,"description":1372,"featured":54},"Model Control Protocol (MCP)","https://github.com/google/model-control-protocol","Protocol for connecting AI models to external tools like Puppeteer",{"name":1374,"url":1375,"description":1376,"featured":54},"Gemini 2.5 Pro","https://ai.google.dev/gemini","Google's LLM used in the demonstration for CSS suggestions",{"name":1378,"url":1379,"description":1380,"featured":54},"PHP local server","https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php","Used to serve static website files locally for testing",{"name":1382,"url":1383,"description":1384,"featured":54},"CSS documentation","https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","Mozilla's comprehensive guide to CSS properties and syntax",[1386,1389,1393,1397,1401,1404,1407,1410,1413,1417,1421,1425],{"title":1387,"url":1388,"timestamp":70},"Introduction to editing CSS with LLMs","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=0",{"title":1390,"url":1391,"timestamp":1392},"Challenges with CSS complexity and versioning","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=45","00:00:45",{"title":1394,"url":1395,"timestamp":1396},"Examining the AI tools lab website and its extensive CSS","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=75","00:01:15",{"title":1398,"url":1399,"timestamp":1400},"Introduction to using Puppeteer for visual context","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=105","00:01:45",{"title":1402,"url":1403,"timestamp":404},"Setting up PHP to serve the static website locally","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=150",{"title":1405,"url":1406,"timestamp":158},"First attempt at querying without Puppeteer enabled","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=180",{"title":1408,"url":1409,"timestamp":491},"Enabling Puppeteer in the MCP server settings","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=240",{"title":1411,"url":1412,"timestamp":408},"Dealing with screenshot approval requirements","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=270",{"title":1414,"url":1415,"timestamp":1416},"Getting CSS suggestions based on the screenshot","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=330","00:05:30",{"title":1418,"url":1419,"timestamp":1420},"Testing CSS changes in a safe test branch","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=390","00:06:30",{"title":1422,"url":1423,"timestamp":1424},"Handling stalled screenshots and retrying","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=435","00:07:15",{"title":1426,"url":1427,"timestamp":1428},"Reviewing the implemented header style changes","https://youtu.be/duMkcV7d_wo?t=465","00:07:45","CSS debugging just got a superpower upgrade. Ryan cracks the code on one of AI development's biggest frustrations: how do you explain visual problems to a model that can't see? His solution is elegantly simple yet revolutionaryâ€”hook up Puppeteer to take screenshots and feed them directly to Gemini 2.5 Pro, creating the first AI assistant that actually knows what your website looks like. Watch him turn the tedious cycle of \"describe the problem, get generic advice, repeat\" into a lightning-fast feedback loop where AI suggestions are based on actual visual evidence. It's like having a design partner who never gets tired of your CSS experiments.","In this presentation, Ryan explores a practical approach to editing CSS with Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on creating a virtuous cycle of design improvements. He highlights the challenges of working with CSS, particularly for developers familiar with older versions who may struggle with modern CSS syntax and styles. Ryan points out that CSS can be complex, with styles defined in multiple locations, making it difficult to track changes and understand their impact across large codebases that may contain thousands of lines of code spread across numerous files.\r\n\r\nRyan demonstrates an innovative solution using Puppeteer through an MCP (Model Control Protocol) server to take screenshots of local websites. This approach allows the LLM to see the visual representation of the site, providing crucial context for making informed CSS recommendations. Throughout the demonstration, Ryan shows how to set up and configure the MCP server, start a local PHP server to host the test site, and use Gemini 2.5 Pro to suggest and implement CSS changes. Despite some workflow challenges such as needing to approve screenshot captures manually, Ryan emphasizes the speed advantages of this approach, noting that the quick feedback cycle creates an efficient workflow that almost mimics real-time browser editing but with AI assistance. The demonstration concludes with a successful modification to the header styling, illustrating the potential of this visual-context approach to AI-assisted CSS editing.","src/content/episodes/ep16.mdx","be933b80f267149b","ep16.mdx","ep17",{"id":1434,"data":1436,"body":1526,"filePath":1527,"digest":1528,"legacyId":1529,"deferredRender":104},{"title":1437,"description":1438,"heroImg":1439,"videoId":1440,"episodeNumber":1441,"date":1442,"author":20,"participants":1443,"tags":1444,"takeaways":1448,"resources":1469,"jumpTo":1488,"summary":1525,"featured":54,"transcriptAvailable":104},"The State of AI 2025: Exploring Developer Tools, Models, and Industry Trends","Jason and Ryan analyze the State of AI 2025 report, examining AI tool popularity, user pain points, and how tools like Google's Notebook LM help synthesize information from multiple sources.","../images/thumbnails/ep17.png","AcPDrBKy_Uw",17,"2025-04-29T00:00:00.000Z",[22,23],[1445,1446,290,1447],"stateofai","notebooklm","chatgpt",[1449,1453,1456,1460,1464],{"text":1450,"tools":1451},"ChatGPT remains the dominant AI model with Claude gaining rapid popularity, but there's a wide ecosystem of AI tools that many developers are still discovering",[1452,449],"ChatGPT",{"text":1454,"tools":1455},"The biggest pain points for AI users remain hallucinations/inaccuracies and context limitations, though these issues are being addressed with newer model versions that offer expanded context windows",[781],{"text":1457,"tools":1458},"Local model deployment is more common than expected (46% of respondents), likely driven by data privacy concerns rather than cost or performance considerations",[1459],"Local Models",{"text":1461,"tools":1462},"Despite concerns about AI-generated code quality, most developers (40%) report being happy with the current state of AI tools for web development, with only 10% being unhappy",[1463],"AI Development Tools",{"text":1465,"tools":1466},"According to DORA research, while generative AI provides individual productivity gains, it may actually have negative impacts on software delivery at organizational levels, suggesting challenges in team integration",[1467,1468],"DORA","Generative AI",[1470,1474,1478,1482,1486],{"name":1471,"url":1472,"description":1473,"featured":54},"The State of AI 2025 Report by Msty.ai","https://2025.stateofai.dev/en-US/","Comprehensive survey results about AI tool usage discussed throughout the episode",{"name":1475,"url":1476,"description":1477,"featured":54},"TL;DR Newsletter","https://tldr.tech/","Tech newsletter where the hosts discovered the State of AI report",{"name":1479,"url":1480,"description":1481,"featured":54},"DORA Report on Generative AI Impact","https://dora.dev/","Research suggesting that generative AI may have negative impacts on software delivery at organizational levels",{"name":1483,"url":1484,"description":1485,"featured":54},"Google's Notebook LM","https://notebooklm.google.com/","Tool demonstrated for synthesizing information from multiple sources",{"name":873,"url":881,"description":1487,"featured":54},"Service mentioned in relation to Cline for accessing multiple AI models",[1489,1492,1496,1499,1503,1507,1510,1513,1517,1521],{"title":1490,"url":1491,"timestamp":70},"Introduction and report identification","https://youtu.be/AcPDrBKy_Uw?t=0",{"title":1493,"url":1494,"timestamp":1495},"Report source and Msty.ai background","https://youtu.be/AcPDrBKy_Uw?t=85","00:01:25",{"title":1497,"url":1498,"timestamp":158},"Demographics of survey respondents","https://youtu.be/AcPDrBKy_Uw?t=180",{"title":1500,"url":1501,"timestamp":1502},"Popular AI model providers and user comments","https://youtu.be/AcPDrBKy_Uw?t=335","00:05:35",{"title":1504,"url":1505,"timestamp":1506},"Exploring IDE tools and lesser-known options","https://youtu.be/AcPDrBKy_Uw?t=536","00:08:56",{"title":1508,"url":1509,"timestamp":170},"IDE pain points and monetary considerations","https://youtu.be/AcPDrBKy_Uw?t=720",{"title":1511,"url":1512,"timestamp":178},"Coding assistants and tools comparison","https://youtu.be/AcPDrBKy_Uw?t=1080",{"title":1514,"url":1515,"timestamp":1516},"AI usage patterns and application types","https://youtu.be/AcPDrBKy_Uw?t=1350","00:22:30",{"title":1518,"url":1519,"timestamp":1520},"Code refactoring needs and quality issues","https://youtu.be/AcPDrBKy_Uw?t=1650","00:27:30",{"title":1522,"url":1523,"timestamp":1524},"Satisfaction with AI tools and psychological impact","https://youtu.be/AcPDrBKy_Uw?t=2040","00:34:00","What happens when 4,000 developers spill the tea on their AI tool usage?

Ryan discusses his approach of using multiple AI models with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, particularly highlighting how he combined Gemini 2.5 Pro's multimodal capabilities with Claude Sonnet 3.7's web search functionality to tackle different aspects of the project. Ryan explains the challenges he faced, including models struggling with large CSS files and Base64-encoded graphics, and reveals his workflow using Puppeteer and Sequential Thinking MCPs in Windsurf to compare and migrate the site effectively. \r\n\r\nThroughout the conversation, Ryan emphasizes the importance of vigilant oversight when allowing AI tools to execute commands, especially around version control and API keys. He demonstrates how to set up MCPs in Windsurf, add Context7 for documentation access, and use to-do lists to checkpoint progress across lengthy AI sessions. Despite some visual discrepancies in the migrated site, Ryan found the process incredibly educational, allowing him to simultaneously learn Astro, improve his testing methodology with Vitest, automate deployments with Netlify, and enhance his work with Claude. Jason Hand, who initially suggested using AI for the migration, expresses excitement about how quickly they've been able to move from a static HTML site to a more maintainable content management system using these AI-powered development approaches.","src/content/episodes/ep20.mdx","78bf4b74431437cc","ep20.mdx","ep24",{"id":1621,"data":1623,"body":1703,"filePath":1704,"digest":1705,"legacyId":1706,"deferredRender":104},{"title":1624,"description":1625,"heroImg":1626,"videoId":1627,"episodeNumber":1628,"date":1629,"author":20,"participants":1630,"tags":1631,"takeaways":1632,"resources":1648,"jumpTo":1661,"summary":1702,"featured":54,"transcriptAvailable":104},"Streamlining AI Report Analysis: Figma AI 2025 Insights","The video discusses the challenges of keeping up with numerous 'State Of' or report PDFs, focusing on a specific AI report by Figma concerning the state of AI in 2025.

Jason reveals his daily ritual of using Claude and Lovable as a \"butterfly net\" for fleeting ideasâ€”capturing those ephemeral thoughts that usually vanish before the caffeine kicks in. Watch him demonstrate client-side URL-based state management in apps built in minutes, not hours. It's part creative exercise, part technical challenge, and entirely addictive. When the barrier between idea and implementation becomes this thin, the question isn't whether you can build itâ€”it's whether you should stop yourself from building everything.","[00:00:00] **Jason Hand:** I have this routine now. Pretty much every morning I wake up outside, drink a cup of coffee or two and read through my emails and different mailing lists and stuff that I'm on.\nAnd occasionally I'll get like an idea. And I'll just immediately switch over to Claude, or, it's usually Claude, but something and. And then just like jam out, like a quick prompt and see if I can get something going as almost like a notebook for me. Like a placeholder. I might not be able to finish it right now in the next cup of coffee.\n[00:00:28] **Ryan MacLean:** Oh yeah. You see you're touching on something that's a big thing for me. Are you using it kinda like Evernote? You've got a bunch of projects in the mix or what have you. \n[00:00:35] **Jason Hand:** I'm just using it as a second brain 'cause I don't trust my own love that you know, same. I. I don't mean that to sound like \n[00:00:42] **Ryan MacLean:** No, I hear you though.\nIf you're working on two or three projects, it's difficult to have the context in your head of the, a lot of \n[00:00:46] **Jason Hand:** ideas just, they come and go. Yeah. And it's just the truth. And I guess that at this point in my life, I've learned like my own little hacks to capture 'em, like butterfly net, it's oh, that's a good one.\nI gotta get it. And I put 'em wherever I can that I know, I know where I'll find them. [00:01:00] And that's what these are, that's what these are turning into, at least when it comes to solving small little problems or doing something that like helps with a hobby. Or, which is like one of some of the stuff I've been working on right.\nOr recently is the summer is here and it's its time to get out and go see your friends and do fun stuff on the weekends and absolutely. Music festivals and just all kinds of fun stuff. And, but unfortunately we all are busy people and we have families and things and it's hard to like schedule time together.\nSo it's a common problem. \n[00:01:32] **Ryan MacLean:** Now there's, before you show us the app I get a quick question, like, how long is this session for you? Because for me to code generally, and I'm talking about maybe pre 2020 brain, it, that's a two to five hour at least process. It takes a long time for me to get into I don't wanna say the zone, but get into the working area where I've got my docs on one screen.\nIt's got probably a command line and an open code editor that'll take me, maybe not two hours, it'll take me at least an hour. To get up to speed to where I was before. And then feel like I'm actually doing some work again. [00:02:00] How long does it take you? Because it feels five minutes for me now if I'm just opening up a, like a Claude session.\n[00:02:05] **Jason Hand:** What I'm actually finding I'm doing unintentionally is I'm using like Claude's free plan. And I'm also been playing around with Lovable, but staying on their free plan. Of course there's limitations for both. Claude has like usage token window yeah. Limits that are they flex, based on like demand.\nAnd you'll run out. Especially like I've started really I told you before we were recording, I, I started really enjoying Astro because we've migrated our site and like I'm learning Astro. So now like a lot of my projects, I want them to be Astro projects. Gotcha. 'cause it just gives me so much flexibility and so many things you can do with it.\nAnd but that's a lot of code. It certainly can be. Yeah. Agreed. I'm running out of I'm basically burning through the free stuff that they give you, whether it's the token limits on Claude, i'm not able to get more than maybe five back and forth conversations. Or prompts and responses.\nWhich isn't all that different from Lovable. You get five and I've been treating it like a challenge. It's not often [00:03:00] it'll get a zero shot. A lot of times the app is functional, it'll do what you said, but it's not what I have in my mind yet.\nBut if I can get there in five, like I, have with Lovable or until I run out of tokens on Claude, and they'll give you more every five hours by the way. But, I don't know. That's kinda my morning challenge. It's like how I've started to like boot up in the morning. \n[00:03:19] **Ryan MacLean:** Is that like half hour of work or an hour of work?\nYeah. Sorry to put a number on it. \n[00:03:23] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, I would say it's probably half hour to 60 minutes or so, and I don't know, some of that's also mixed. I, IGI bounce back and forth between reading stuff and maybe even also like doing a little research on something I just learned about. It's usually no more than 90 minutes of total time.\n[00:03:40] **Ryan MacLean:** That's amazing to me. I'm pulling out the soapbox here just a little bit. 'cause I feel like this to me is like, when I used to play video games, I would sit for, I don't know, it felt like 18 to 20 hours at a time. These days I might have 10 minutes for a video game. And the term for that is called game snacking.\nAnd this feels to me like code snacking or dev snacking. I don't need to pin a term on it, but it does [00:04:00] feel like a different way of coding that feels it. It scratches that same itch but in a much shorter timeframe. And it feels can come back to it a lot easier than I used to be able to.\n[00:04:08] **Jason Hand:** It does. And that itch is oh, I wonder if I can solve that problem that I now have. Yeah. And here's another problem I have, I like to go stand up paddle boarding. And there's a ton of really great bodies of water around for me to go, when I can. But the weather is like the main thing that depends on if it's good conditions.\nYou don't want it to be windy. Depending on if you're planning on being in the water's too cold. There's just stuff that you wanna know about. So I tried to build a little app that uses open , meteorological data that's out there and do that.\nAnd it was just like that was a problem I was trying to solve in that moment. I wanted to go paddle boarding. I wasn't sure where I wanted to go and because I've done this enough times to know that I've got 90 minutes to spare, right? Lemme just see if I can solve this. In a fun way and learn something along the way.\nAnd usually what happens is if it doesn't work, it's just a toss out, I just toss it back. \n[00:04:56] **Ryan MacLean:** Throwaway code, yeah. Whatever. \n[00:04:57] **Jason Hand:** Yep. And I learned, definitely learned something in [00:05:00] that time. And then, but if it turns out to be good or something's, I want to continue on this and I have the time to continue on it, whether it's immediately or later, I can then drop it into Cursor is what I've been doing Right.\nSo that's just turned into my workflow lately. Just get a bunch of ideas going and then ones that actually have some legs, I take 'em to the next level.\nOr lately sharing them a little bit more with some others and just trying to get some feedback. \n[00:05:25] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. Yeah. So is your spitball approach primarily Lovable or Claude free? Is that, those are your tools that you start with. \n[00:05:31] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, right now it's Claude's probably my go-to where I reach first to just get that like I said, notepad type of thing, get something going.\nBut Lovable has been like, I would say. Definitely number two, but the thing that's fun about that there's this term that I had to look up because when I started trying to figure out what I wanted to build here, I knew that I didn't want to have a real big architecture. I don't want like a backend like database and yeah. Cloud [00:06:00] storage, I didn't really want that's not how much, how obsessed I am about solving my own problems.\nAnd also, I don't know, lately I'm just so fed up with being tracked by all of the different tracking. I. \n[00:06:12] **Ryan MacLean:** I don't think you're alone. I'm seeing a renewed interest in, in, not using Facebook and not using a lot of the social media apps, but trying to figure out what we can get it done on your own.\n[00:06:21] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. It just really, it bums me out every time I see. So a cool new tool that I, I want to go try and it, you have to sign in with an email address, right? And create profile and stuff. And I was like. You don't always need that. That's not always the functionality that you have to have just to get the job done.\nAnd that's what I was trying to do here with this app is like I was saying it's summertime and there's things to do and people to see and I wanted to create something like, it's a calendar. Oh, this is cool, that thank you. That allows me to choose days that I'm gonna be, am I going to see the bear naked lady?\nI know that man. Yeah. Maybe I'll say I am gonna see that. And the reason why it New Red Rocks is there, is I've got these custom calendars that I Oh, cool. Hold it to display so we can put the Red Rocks [00:07:00] calendars in there. The main ones I'm actually the most interested in is all the bluegrass festivals that happen in Colorado.\nThis will show those, and if I say I'm gonna be at this yes, I'm attending that and that, and then done. And I would go through and just make all my selections right. And actually I'm logged (in air quotes). As you in this, okay, so I just sat here and said I don't want to have this profile thing and user set up, but there is that kind of functionality.\nIt turns out you can do that in the URL. Gotcha. And I think we've known that, or I've known that forever, but I've never really set out to build something that operates that way. \n[00:07:31] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. I'm only in there using UTM codes and things like that so what else can you put in that? 'cause I love playing with UTM codes.\nSomebody will send me a link and I'll change the referral or what have you, just to play around and see what they're doing. \n[00:07:41] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, there's, you're basically so what's weird is here I'll actually finish making my selections here. When you. Make all your selections and then you go into the results.\nWe can see all the days where, it's a good, it's a good day for you and I to get together. Both of us are available on June [00:08:00] 5th. And so I can then say, come in here and say let's get together for, dinner or something. And then hit create invite and that's gonna create a Google invite that you can put in your calendar.\nBut the real like way to share this around and get me and you to put on in our own stuff is you have to hit down on the calendar. And I'm gonna move this to where it's displayed everywhere. You just hit share. Okay. And this huge, so if I hit that, this huge pull up the notepad here.\nLink. Oh, wow. Is what gets generated. Okay. So I don't know if you can see that, \n[00:08:33] **Ryan MacLean:** but I can Yeah. \n[00:08:34] **Jason Hand:** Make it a little bigger. So that's the URL, right? With all this encoded. Oh, I see what's \n[00:08:39] **Ryan MacLean:** going. So it's saying true for certain dates. I can parse this a bit. \n[00:08:42] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. encoded. So there's users, there's user Id name, there's Jason, and the dates that I've selected, it's not exactly human readable, but this is like the temporary database that we're basically handing back and forth.\nAnd building on, if like I, I make some changes, I need to then create a new link and pass it [00:09:00] back to you, and that'll be up to date. And then if you make some changes, you'll have to pass it back to me. But we can bookmark these and save 'em, turn 'em into hyperlinks to actually create state almost.\nYou know what I mean? Like I could say my, what I, my selections last week were this URL, but my selections this week are this URL. So you can create like a re like a history, if you wanted. Great. Anyway, it just really got me thinking about all the ways that you could use this type of data storage.\nAnd so this has been the app that I've been working on the most since we last got together. But then I put together this other one, which is related, but I did it on Lovable. You'll see that. I see that. Yeah. \n[00:09:35] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. But it looks the same. \n[00:09:37] **Jason Hand:** It I made it look the same. Okay. I told it like, let's use the styling even though it's over unLovable.\nAnd one day I'll probably give it a real domain, but. Yeah. One of the other challenges, yeah, I think for me and my friend groups, and again, probably literally everybody, is when you're going doing fun stuff, sometimes you get together and you all chip in on expenses and you're trying to figure out later like how to split costs, or maybe you have a big dinner date and there's [00:10:00] 10 of you.\nSplitting costs is just always a headache. So I, that was something else I wanted to, solve for Oh, I like that. APIs and IPAs. Yeah. Perfect. And then of course there's, I'm not gonna put my Vimo in, but there, if I did, you could then send me stuff. But there's tools. There's like SplitWise that could handle this.\nThere's Doodle.com which can handle like the calendar stuff, but again, I don't want to go log in and give them all my. Email information. Yeah, I think we were looking \n[00:10:28] **Ryan MacLean:** at Doodle the other day. It's changed hands a few times, so I worry about where that data's being used. Yeah. Is my thing. And then people in the US use, is it Cash App or Venmo that I think are splitting stuff.\nBut then as a Canadian, I don't use either of those. So this is, yeah, it's constantly a concern for me. \n[00:10:41] **Jason Hand:** Exactly. And now I'm gonna put this up. Already in, in GitHub, and so go. Just deploy this somewhere yourself, and you don't have to use those tools. \n[00:10:51] **Ryan MacLean:** Oh, that's \n[00:10:51] **Jason Hand:** cool. So anyway I was just kinda like making up numbers here, but put you in here and put myself in here.\nYou can also change the colors pretty much anything that you wanna change can be stored in the [00:11:00] URL and it's pretty fun. So yeah, I owe you $10.50 and we could say maybe there's one other person, maybe Rick was gonna join us or something. And then, so we're gonna actually split that three ways now.\nSo there's three people for two expenses. Now Rick just owes you 22 and me, Jason, or me a dollar. Gotcha. So if we \n[00:11:22] **Ryan MacLean:** had supper two nights in a row and I paid one night, you paid the other night kind of thing, this would definitely solve that. Yeah, exactly. And then if Rick came along for both and didn't pay anything sort of thing.\n[00:11:31] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. If as long, assuming you like, just waited till the end to tally it all up. You just put in your stuff. And again, you can share this around, like I put in my amount and then I'll like text it to you and you put in your amount. Anyway, I just got, I told you the other day in chat I've become obsessed with trying to find other little apps.\nI can make that, that do this, but. DASH is upon us in that, but \n[00:11:51] **Ryan MacLean:** yeah, our internal event is taking up a lot of time. I do wonder though, have you tried making these apps in multiple places or do you typically just use because you're using two different types here. I guess I [00:12:00] wondering about the rubric or how you, what that thought process is.\nOr is it just you reach for the one that's closer and try it out and Yeah. And see how far you can go? \n[00:12:07] **Jason Hand:** I guess I was saying I usually start with. A Claude, right? But one thing that I did realize in this most recent session with Lovable, with this the Split Something app is, lemme get in here to, oh, it's down here.\nPlease forget that they're right down here. \n[00:12:23] **Ryan MacLean:** A paddle weather whisperer. I like these names. I can figure out what it's trying to do. Yeah, we can come back to \n[00:12:27] **Jason Hand:** that one. \n[00:12:27] **Ryan MacLean:** The self weather tracker. \n[00:12:30] **Jason Hand:** So the deal with this is, I told you that I started in Lovable, but you only get five wishes, so you can only do thing five times and then, but one of the neat things, I guess it's neat for me, at least in this situation, is that you can push it up into GitHub okay?\nAnd just create a new repo. From right here. So I like that idea. 'cause if it's a, if I like where this is headed I do want to get it into GitHub pretty soon because from there I'm going to probably play with it in multiple places. So I hadn't really taken advantage of [00:13:00] that intentionally until now.\nAnd as you can see over here on the left, once I put it up into GitHub, I then pulled it up into Cursor, started doing things over there and it. Automatically all I was doing was just making some read changes to the README initially, but it automatically noticed the changes in the repo. \n[00:13:18] **Ryan MacLean:** That's cool.\n[00:13:19] **Jason Hand:** And I could then review the changes over here and see it. And then another thing observation here about this whole process is just because, I guess now I have a better understanding of how Lovable works. It's not going to just redeploy the app. Now that it's in GitHub and you've pushed code back in, there isn't some sort of automation, continuous, like CI/CD build.\nThat just happens, right? Then you still gotta come back into Lovable and then there'll be a, an option up there to, I think it's, I don't think it's Publish and it's like redeploy or re- something \n[00:13:51] **Ryan MacLean:** Refresh or something like that. Yeah. Okay. \n[00:13:52] **Jason Hand:** Exactly. 'cause no, it sees that the code has changed and at that point now it's deployed obviously onto Lovable infrastructure and the app and everything [00:14:00] will work through the URL, that's been the process for these few is I'll start in the cheap sections or, in the, in the free stuff if I like where it's headed, let's get it into GitHub. And then from there I usually bring it down into Cursor and if things are really not going the direction I want them to, I get out Claude Code and because it Gotcha.\nIt just seems to like. Read my mind and do exactly what I'm, I need it to, but I try not to always default to that. Like I, I like. Understanding all of them. \n[00:14:30] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. This feels like a rapid application development framework of some sort. Even though it, on your end, it might feel like you're cooking spaghetti and throwing it at the wall.\nIt's the fact that you can try different ideas this quickly and iterate that fast, even if you have to go to GitHub and then refresh a page. To me is a benefit because as someone who doesn't do front end, this would be me asking a team to do something, waiting a week or two, and then seeing what they come back with only to realize my actual architecture was wrong or the premise that I had come up with wrong or the [00:15:00] framework I was using or wrong that the idea was wrong.\nThere's something fundamentally wrong with my idea. Yeah. Not with their code, but like with the instructions I've given them \n[00:15:08] **Jason Hand:** and some of them like have been. They just they exposed to me how complex this might be. And I have to decide, do I want to go that right way? This sounds fun, but like I need to stay in this quick ideas, like just what are the little things that have been bugging me that I can just solve, and let's move on.\nI'll save the complex ones for later when things have, evolved. And also I've run out of small problems. Okay. But at least I got 'em documented and I can come back to 'em. \n[00:15:41] **Ryan MacLean:** The other thing that sticks out to me is in a pre gen AI world, and let's say it's 2019 or maybe 2018. For me at least I might write the ideas down, but I definitely would not have done anything.\nSo I'd have a list of 20 ideas, maybe 30 at the end of a couple weeks of working [00:16:00] on something. And chances are I may have spitballed on one of them, maybe two. If that though, to be fair, \n[00:16:06] **Jason Hand:** yeah. I have to yeah. Acknowledge the privilege that I have to sit Yeah, exactly. Sit outside on my front porch and just drink coffee and, ideate and read and learn and build and then start my day kinda off like that way. And then I, and then I take. \n[00:16:20] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. The promise of remote work was on the beach with your, Mai Tai, what have you. Oh, that, stuff like I, listen I worked remote and that still wasn't a reality for me.\nThere was still stuff that you I needed a bit more access. This does feel like a. I don't wanna say lone wolf, but something that you can do solo pretty easily without too much interaction, and then go back to a team and say, Hey I played around with this on the weekend. It looks like there's a new feature in Astro version five called, I don't know, component collections or, so something like that.\nI forget what they're called, but some collections that we can use as a result. Let's try that. Here's an example. Let's not use this, but here's an example that I got with Lovable or Bolt or Claude or what have you. That to me is [00:17:00] incredibly valuable because again, as someone who doesn't do a lot of front end it, it's amazing for me to be able to try that stuff out.\nSo I, I think what I was looking for is some sort of other methodologies so you're saying five tries is generally when you'll stop you'll try a different tool. It's not time-based. It's more about what can you get done for free with a couple iterations or up to five iterations.\nThen you'll pick up either Claude Code or if it's really serious Cursor is what it sounds like, and then you'll work from there and get. Like a human in the loop and another person to give you your feedback and then settle the features. Does that encompass? Yeah, \n[00:17:29] **Jason Hand:** and you know what?\nNow that you say that out loud, \n[00:17:34] **Ryan MacLean:** sorry to rationalize it, but this sounds awesome. I just need friends, I think is the only thing. So what I, \n[00:17:38] **Jason Hand:** what but what it is, basically what I'm doing is like exactly what I do with like songwriting. Oh yeah. Is gotta, when the. Look, we're not always in the right head space for things.\nAnd so when you are, you gotta jump on it. And that's that's what I'm, that's what those 90 minutes or whatever, it's, yeah, it changes, but that's what that is for me. It's collection, it's creation and collection time. And I've figured out I can use that [00:18:00] as like just getting ideas to bubble up.\nAnd then use the time that I have to see if I can make some sort of progress. And it's just a phased approach, like you have, I have. A hundred ideas. I get 'em down to five. Yeah. From there I get 'em down to two and then we go, do, we do the next thing. And that the fact that we can all do that now.\nYeah. The. There's gonna be a lot of people solving their problems, which I think is awesome. Which \n[00:18:24] **Ryan MacLean:** brings me to my next question. This is ma may I've got a solution, but I dunno what you're doing, but my brain feels like it's a squirrel and I'll look the other way and something grabs my attention all the time, especially now that we're, ramping up to an internal conference.\nI've got a little bit less time than usual. I'm babysitting some dogs, my own dogs, let's be honest. But if they got any health problems or something like that, I might be dealing with them for a second, then come back to the computer and traditionally like that. And one two minute change of not looking at something would mean when I came back it would take me about 15 minutes to ramp up to what I was like, maybe not that bad, maybe about five minutes.\nThese days though, it feels like I can just type continue and [00:19:00] continue on. That being said, there's sometimes when I change tools that I really miss not having that context from whatever chat session I had. Sometimes I'll copy that out and do I might say the prompt or the system prompt or what have you.\nA-P-R-D-I think we talked about before. I've been using todos a lot these days, but how are you keeping that context between maybe different days or if you're handing off to a different person or a different tool? What does that look like for you? Because todo is my answer and I, I don't think it's the best, but that's all I've got right now.\n[00:19:27] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. I think for these, I don't believe I'm using. To do. Let me, \n[00:19:34] **Ryan MacLean:** And for those listening, I'm literally just talking about like a todo markdown file with check boxes in it. This is as sophisticated as I've gotten at this point in time. \n[00:19:42] **Jason Hand:** I've got a Claude file.\nOkay. Okay. Like a CLAUDE.md, because it had, I did bring it into Claude Code at some point. \n[00:19:49] **Ryan MacLean:** Okay. And does Claude Code do that by default? Having only played with it once? I didn't notice.\n[00:19:53] **Jason Hand:** It's a good question. I don't remember if I act, if I prompted it to make this. Okay. I think it created, its on its own 'cause there's not a [00:20:00] lot here.\nInteresting. I wanna say it probably, yeah I don't know if I remember exactly when that was created, but that's all I've gotten. Really in here, I do have a roadmap file that I like started that was gonna be like my to-do. \n[00:20:14] **Ryan MacLean:** That's a good one. Yeah. When you're thinking down the road for other features or what have you.\nOkay. \n[00:20:18] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. And actually I did that, like the first version of it is here.\nI do have, like I said, there, there's a CLAUDE.md file in here, but it's really small. I think it was created automatically. I don't remember asking it to do that. But my roadmap file is like my similar to, to do but really meant to be like feature requests. So the first version I had of this, I sent out to some folks.\nThey came back and told me, it'd be great if I could send it out to multiple groups of people and keep that somehow still straight. Like some are my like music friends and some are family and like, how do I like visually see that? At first I was like, I dunno if I can do that without having some sort of backend like state management.\nAnd then the same with also getting granular down to the [00:21:00] time, like what specific time, not just what day. Yeah. But the more I was like thinking about it, I was like, I think it, it's just another. It's just another number, just another like variable to be stored in the URL. I don't know why we can't do that.\nSo I can actually check this off. I did that. And that's pretty much all I've done so far. I haven't gotten probably more than four hours total time into this. \n[00:21:23] **Ryan MacLean:** That's pretty good too. If you think about the actual amount of work that you've done versus the output that's. Yeah, that's actually pretty incredible.\nI \n[00:21:29] **Jason Hand:** was really impressed with the you know what, I might actually be able to pull up the first one. It gave me the zero shot. Let's see. You can see all the stuff. Colorado su standup paddleboard location app. Oh I made a little wordle game. A bluegrass themed Wordle. You like \n[00:21:52] **Ryan MacLean:** Wordle? That's amazing.\nI do, in fact, like Wordle I'm enamored in with the fact that you can resume your state by just opening the same [00:22:00] URL again. Yeah. I think is what I really likem. \n[00:22:02] **Jason Hand:** I've got a really nice what do you call it, telescope, like deep space telescope. Not deep space, but like a good telescope. Yeah. Yeah. And I wanted to see if I could.\nFigure, find something, build something that helped me, choose which day and time I should go. Go look at stuff. Didn't make very far on that one.\n[00:22:18] **Ryan MacLean:** I'm loving this list of ideas, like each one. So each session is a new idea. I guess one of my problems with Claude is that my brain is just all over the place, so I'll end up putting three or four ideas into the same thing and then it gets confused halfway through it.\nWe'll change my weather app into a translation app just 'cause of the way that I started talking to it. So I've gotta be careful to split that stuff out. But it looks like you've you've already learned that. \n[00:22:38] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. It is a good way to compartmentalize things. And you know me to go back, I completely forgot if the word wordle thing, and yeah, so that's another one. And it's actually, it works. So I gotta go back and kinda tinker with that. Very cool. But this was the first conversation I had. So let's see, make this a little bigger. Wanna build a web app to help me find dates where multiple people are available on the same day, [00:23:00] like doodle.com, but only the date, not the time is important.\nWant users to see a counter view, select all the dates and. States blocked. The app will then show all the best options for dates where the most people are available. \n[00:23:12] **Ryan MacLean:** I gotta say, this is the worst project definition I've ever seen. This is a Jira ticket. You know what I mean? This is one of those ones where you're like, ah, it's that project manager.\nLike really? \n[00:23:23] **Jason Hand:** Sometimes an idea is just, but that is \n[00:23:24] **Ryan MacLean:** fantastic. The fact that you can run with that and just a, like a natural human language way of speaking to a an engineer is phenomenal, right? You don't like, I need it done by Wednesday. It's a large t-shirt size. I, I realize you're also busy on these other things, but this is a priority two.\nSo please prioritize it. Okay. Appropriately. This is fantastic. It removes all that headache of overhead of dealing with an engineering team. At the same time, you can do this while doing other things like drinking your coffee. This phenomenal to me. \n[00:23:52] **Jason Hand:** It just \n[00:23:53] **Ryan MacLean:** helps me \n[00:23:53] **Jason Hand:** get some ideas, \n[00:23:54] **Ryan MacLean:** Even this first iteration that you're showing me here, I guess it says V two, but this looks pretty good.\n[00:23:59] **Jason Hand:** It [00:24:00] does, yeah. Does what it. Is supposed to do that. This \n[00:24:03] **Ryan MacLean:** is a really good rapid application development tool, which a couple \n[00:24:06] **Jason Hand:** things here, and then we look at the results and yeah, that's all three people are available. That's phenomenal. So that's what it got like on shot one. \n[00:24:14] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.\nOr zero. This is great. The way that it can create React apps that are just in a sidebar and Claude I, I think is fantastic. Be it in, in, in web or desktop or even the iOS app. I've noticed is, it's actually pretty neat to me just to visualize the idea that I hadn't realized, oh, no, that's actually.\nYou know what, why would you do that? Like you, you don't need the times of the day. Actually what I need is the date. And then realizing that's your feature set and going back to the well to get more, that, that's fantastic. I think the key is that you can get that result out there quickly and then iterate the problem with me.\nI guess I. Past me prior to 2022 would be that I just wouldn't get started. 'cause it was so hard to get started. Yeah. And now it's no, I can get started on five or six different things and then pick the best out of them instead of just sitting there worried about how much time this [00:25:00] gonna take and not doing anything or over planning.\nThat is really cool. I. \n[00:25:03] **Jason Hand:** I do not like to waste time. And finally, I feel like I'm not wasting time by just exploring something. There used to be so many different things I'd wanna do with raspberry pies and Oh, don't get me started. I \n[00:25:14] **Ryan MacLean:** got 12. Yeah. Don't get started. Absolutely. And I just, I \n[00:25:16] **Jason Hand:** know that I'll get I don't know, days in and realize this isn't working and.\nAnd I have this like a dread, this like feeling that washes over me. I'm like, that was a waste of time. And I just out like that's time is like the one thing I do not waste.\n[00:25:31] **Ryan MacLean:** That is really cool. Listen I learned a lot from your process. I've been using. Bolt a lot and Claude Desktop and ChatGPT to a lesser extent.\nBut those are the three sort of tools that I use. I will say every time I've used Lovable I get Lovable results. And I hate to say that 'cause it's funny, but it's absolutely true is that I do enjoy my time in that app and it feels if we're still voting with our wallet it's almost time to stop the Bolt subscription and maybe move over to the Lovable.\nIt is where I'm at, but I have paid for Claude and it [00:26:00] wasn't cheap. I do feel like I'm getting my money out of it, and that's. That's not just like Claude sonnet for coding as an API key, but also the actual chat app. I do like it. I do pay for ChatGPT, but I've noticed myself using it less and less primarily because I'm using Claude for coding and I get more value out of coding than I do talking to ChatGPT about random things.\nIt's not my search engine. It doesn't do that yet for me. I don't know if it does for you.\n[00:26:25] **Jason Hand:** Occasionally I'll start there on some things, but yeah, it's not, that's not why I'm the same with you. Like most of the stuff I've been wanting to do lately is solve my own problems. And I don't want to just, yeah.\nI could go use Doodle and I love Doodle. I've used it for years. That's what we've used. It's worked fine. I just wanted to make something else. It's a solvable problem that I can take care of myself now. Yeah. \n[00:26:44] **Ryan MacLean:** That solve your own problems, that citizen developer thing to me is very exciting.\nThat means like the amount of people who can code seems to have increased. I'm bringing down a bar. I think here I'm lowering the bar for more people to start coding because I know it's difficult to say what the total addressable market is for developers out [00:27:00] there, but I do feel like this is.\nIt feels like it's exponentially growing as a result of making these tools more accessible. \n[00:27:06] **Jason Hand:** Yep. More equitable. Just more \n[00:27:08] **Ryan MacLean:** totally agree. \n[00:27:09] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. That's probably about all the time we have to talk today, so that was awesome. \n[00:27:15] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah. Thank you very much for showing us what you've been up to. \n[00:27:17] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. It's been fun.\nKind of, finding time. Usually, like I said in the morning to, to work on it. 'cause as soon as I close the iPad and go, go up to my office, it's been DASH. \n[00:27:26] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah, that's what happens this time of year. Yeah, for sure.\n[00:27:28] **Jason Hand:** But I'm DASH is closing is, we're almost here, so a week away.\nOnce, once we get through that, then we can we have a lot of plans we wanna make with the, with this program and what we're doing here, so \n[00:27:37] **Ryan MacLean:** Absolutely. \n[00:27:38] **Jason Hand:** It'd be nice to be able to focus on that. And anyway, thanks Ryan and no thank you. That was awesome. We'll talk to you on the next one.\nAll right. Bye \n[00:27:46] **Ryan MacLean:** folks.","Jason Hand and Ryan MacLean chat and demonstrate practical uses of Claude and Lovable in coming up with and building on ideas very quickly .. daily .. almost as a personal challenge. Jason shares his morning routine of using these tools almost as a \"second brain\" or notebook to capture fleeting ideas that come during his morning coffee time outdoors and how turning to tools like Claude or Lovable feels like using a butterfly net to capture ideas, storing them for later exploration, dissection, or problem-solving. \r\n\r\nThey discuss their tendencies to juggle multiple projects simultaneously and the challenges that accompany keeping track of all those ideas without losing context. They highlight how AI allows them to quickly kickstart projects they might otherwise only conceptualize in traditional notepads or task managers. \r\n\r\nJason details his personal approach of using free plans on Claude.ai and Lovable.dev, strategically working within usage limits as a daily challenge. This habit not only sparks creativity and idea capturing mechanism, but also aids him in solving real-life problems through simple applications he has built like [**\"See Ya There\"**](https://seeyathere.netlify.app/) and [**\"Split Sumthin\"**](https://color-coded-budget-buddy.lovable.app/) to help organize friend gatherings at bluegrass festivals or to split expenses with others, but without the hassle of logging into or registering for a service with his Gmail account. These problems shouldn't require a user to give up their personal information to solve a problem. \r\n\r\nJason also points out how such accessible tools reduce initial complexity barriers, allowing him to rapidly prototype solutions that he can later refine or abandon based on effectivenessâ€”thus paralleling themes familiar in songwriting processes where ideas are synthesized before being fleshed out.","src/content/episodes/ep31.mdx","37624da81d15fed6","ep31.mdx","ep32",{"id":2260,"data":2262,"body":2327,"filePath":2329,"digest":2330,"legacyId":2331,"deferredRender":104},{"title":2263,"description":2264,"heroImg":2265,"videoId":2266,"episodeNumber":2267,"date":2268,"author":20,"participants":2269,"tags":2270,"takeaways":2273,"resources":2296,"jumpTo":2310,"summary":2327,"featured":54,"transcriptAvailable":104,"transcriptContent":2328},"Claude Code findings with Rust and TypeScript through Ray Tracing projects","In this candid engineering chat, Datadog developer advocate Scott Gerring walks Jason Hand through his latest experiments with Anthropic's Claude Code assistant.

Gerring shows off a ray-traced teapot scene that Claude generated almost entirely on its own. By conversationally prescribing high-level architecture and letting the model write the Rust, he ended up with clean, compiler-checked interfaces for materials, impressive Lambertian shading and glass refractions, and a working multithreaded rendererâ€”all things that would have sounded like science-fiction two years ago. Yet the demo also exposes Claude's more comedic failure modes: a 'random' axis picker implemented as a global static counter wrapped in an unsafe block, a crippling global mutex that turns a progress bar into a five-times performance penalty, and subtle rendering artifacts caused by omitting the classic ray-origin epsilon offset. Beyond graphics, Gerring describes using Claude Code as a pragmatic coding mule. It rapidly scaffolded a TypeScript ETL pipeline that ingests Datadog integration metadata into the new DevHub site powered by Astro, complete with strongly-typed schemas and a bespoke GitHub API client. The assistant excelled at mechanical mapping and refactoring chores that normally burn hours of human focus, but it stumbled when asked to wire up Jest unit-testsâ€”introducing brittle module-system changes that broke the entire build. At the bleeding edge, Claude still falters on Rust compiler internals for architectural linting, reminding us that engineers must recognise success criteria and domain pitfalls before blindly shipping AI-generated code. The pair close by musing about shared organisational context windows, multi-modal workflows like handwriting drafts on a Supernote then piping PDFs through Claude for flawless transcription, and the exciting potential of Datadog's new MCP for autonomous incident remediation. The through-line: lean on generative AI for the repetitive drudgery, but keep seasoned intuitionâ€”plus good observabilityâ€”at the helm.","[00:00:00] **Jason Hand:** I heard you've you've been doing a little bit more with some of the stuff we talked about.\n[00:00:04] **Scott Gerring:** I think, the main thing we talked about last was I.\nKind of my fancy terminal stuff. It's not that fancy really, but I think lots of people who haven't spent much time in the terminal before are probably quite interested in that. And then Claude Code was the thing that I was using that was novel in there. But as part of that whole thing, the whole thing, I've been building with Claude and using the terminal and thinking about programming and generative AI and whatnot.\nA lot recently, probably like everyone who's programming, I would say I have some observations and some other things and bits of code that went well and bits of code that didn't go well and so on that are probably interesting to look at. I think, \n[00:00:39] **Jason Hand:** maybe you can pull up your screen here and show us the next level of understanding that you've come to with a lot of these things.\n[00:00:47] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah . I'll show you my teapots first really quickly because as I say, still very into the teapots. I'll just quickly switch desktops here for a second. This is the output that we're getting out of this thing that I've built with a ray [00:01:00] tracer. With code, it looks about right. It's very noisy because that's what, ray trace renders look like when you don't run them for ages, and I don't have days and days to wait for my shiny teapots, but it's it's roughly okay.\nAnd I the whole thing I did with it was, Hey, Claude Code, go and build this thing. And I gave it advice about how to build it based on my knowledge of how to build these things. So I was very prescriptive with it, but only conversationally, and I left the code completely alone. Until it got to the point where I had my shiny teapots and then I went and had a bit of a poke around to see what fun things I could find.\nAnd there's a mix of stuff that went really well. I think, obviously the teapots came out the end, which is effectively magic. I think if you, if. I told someone two years ago, a computer program could write other computer programs for you and they'd be pretty decent. They'd be very surprised about that and stuff.\nThat's like pretty horrible and gross, but like discoverable and fixable, I would say. \n[00:01:50] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. I, another thing too, you, it took what we talked about in the recording and then you did a brown bag for our team internally and everybody loved it. And [00:02:00] you had made a comment or there was a section in your presentation about just the grossness of the code and \n[00:02:05] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah, I get strange, I said like strange guttural reactions to things sometimes, but it's, I think it's the creativity of some of the failure modes I guess.\nBut it was also really interesting, the bag, I thought, because obviously our colleague Rory. Also did half the brown bag and he was also talking about generative ai. And we basically we built two completely different things. Like I built this ray racer and he built a system for auditing Kubernetes control plan actions, as I recall.\n[00:02:32] **Jason Hand:** And. \n[00:02:33] **Scott Gerring:** The domain was very different, but the conclusions at the end were very similar about when you can use it effectively when you can't. And I thought that was really interesting. And it comes back to what you were saying about the community call. Lots of people are playing with this stuff and everyone ends up with the same Yeah, very similar opinions about it.\n[00:02:47] **Jason Hand:** Exactly. It feels to me like we've all, we're all taking our time and taking turns, like entering this new mysterious world that we don't really understand, everything around and we're all just reaching for the edges, reaching [00:03:00] for the walls. What, how far can I go before like I'm in danger?\nOr how far can I go before this is not useful? You know what I mean? We're just all like very carefully exploring and then turning that around and being like, Hey, here's what I found out. \n[00:03:14] **Scott Gerring:** Pass it on. Yeah, exactly. And I think that's also the way to do it with new tools. Like you want to crash at high speed into the boundaries rather than like incrementally working out from what's safe and reasonable.\nBut yeah. Anyway, let me show you some code. Yeah. And I'll start with the positive stuff because I was very skeptical about the whole generative AI coding assistant thing to start with. I think lots of programmers have been doing it for a while. Work. But it does a lot of stuff really well, so I think it's important to focus on that rather than just getting the boot in immediately.\n[00:03:43] **Jason Hand:** Agreed. \n[00:03:44] **Scott Gerring:** This is a bit of the Ray tracer and I don't need you or everyone listening to understand what's going on too much, but the important part is that it's an interface. So it's an interface that represents [00:04:00] some material in your Ray tracer. That can reflect light, which means anything that you render, like you have a shiny piece of metal or you have some diffuse surface, it can reflect light.\nAnd this interface describes how that material reflects light. And it's really good because it's correct, right? Like it looks exactly like what you would expect this interface to look like if you go on Google, the myriad of rate racing tutorials on the internet. And the cool upshot of that is that because it's an interface and all the different materials that Claude Code went and built for me in my little toy ray tracer.\nInherit or implement this interface, they're all forced to look roughly correct. And I think because it's this compiler check thing where it gets the interface right, and then it goes and builds a bunch of code that has to force that shape. It really helps it get the materials right as well. So it's like relying on the compiler to do the compiler's job, to push it in the right direction.\nSo it starts from something that's pretty correct and then it extends out from there. So this doesn't really tell you much more, but this is a concrete example of that this is a lambertian material, which just means like a [00:05:00] diffuse surface saying it's not very reflective and it's shaped again, pretty much like what you would expect.\nBut I think because the foundational interface was right and the code follows from that. So I looked at this and I was like, oh, hey, this is exactly what I've written, would've written myself. Great job. \n[00:05:16] **Jason Hand:** Now when you say it's right, is that what you mean? It's what you would have done? Or is there objectively a right and wrong way of doing this that you can write tests around?\n[00:05:27] **Scott Gerring:** It's probably a little bit more nuanced than I made it sound. There's lots of different ways you can build Ray races, and I'm by no means an expert, right? Like I'm a hobbyist with an enthusiasm for these things. But if you go and do like a mid-tier path tracing sort of thing, you would end up with something that is very similar to this.\nSo there's not really an objective truth, but you would expect an evaluator sample and a PDF function on it, and you would expect roughly these parameters. There are variants, but it's insofar as you could be objectively right with this is. [00:06:00] So I think this is really cool. Like it's spot on.\nYou look at it, you're like, nice one. If anyone who is listening knows more about Ray Races than me and would like to tell me about subtle nuance in this please let me know because I'm always interested in letting you might be the expert, very much doubt that. But yeah, I mean that there are cool toy problem.\nCool. And there was another one of this. It's the same sort of thing. So this is for a material, it tells you how light scatters when it hits it. It's pretty similar again. And it has the same nice property where things that extend this are forced into the correct shape by virtue of it. Having got a decent interface out\nnow for the funnel ones or the ones that I think are funnel some stuff that didn't go so well. And we'll start off with this, which I have called Static Globals. And I need to explain this 'cause I think it's very creative. It's a function that's meant to pick a random axis. So X, Y, or Z, which means a random number between zero and two.\nAnd [00:07:00] generating random numbers in rust is not a hard thing to do. This isn't something that you need to have elaborate work around for, but what it's done, instead of generating a random number and you can see in its comment that it thinks maybe it should actually generate a random number, is create a global mutable static counter.\nAnd then bump it whenever somebody calls the function from any thread and return the next value. So by virtue of lots of threads calling this thing at once, it's gonna look random, but it's just an incrementing, rotating counter. And this is really funny because, if you got a graduate programmer or someone, somebody who would just started programming and said, go and build me this, there's no way that would come up with something like this.\nIt's creative in its horror. So I saw it and I was like, wow, this is really something new.\n[00:07:46] **Jason Hand:** I liken the comment that it says we'd normally use a proper random number generator, but Yeah. And then it goes on to write seven lines of code. \n[00:07:55] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah. And I really wish I had the chat history from it because I think it would've been one of those ones where it [00:08:00] reflects, like it, it would've tried to use it and it got the wrong package or something, and it was like, that doesn't seem to work time to do it this way instead.\nBut unfortunately, let's three \n[00:08:09] **Jason Hand:** force our random. \n[00:08:11] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah, and the fact that it's had to wrap this in an unsafe block is also deeply funny. This is not normally something you would see in ordinary rust code, \n[00:08:19] **Jason Hand:** Okay. Let's actually talk about that for a second. If you caught that you look at that and like almost throw up in your mouth, right?\nI don't know that I would honestly, I don't know rust well enough to spot, but I wouldn't be working in Rust. I know the dangers of being in a language that I don't understand what the gen AI's created. But let's pretend. Somebody has created something and it slipped through.\nWhat what does that set off in your mind, like alarms? \n[00:08:41] **Scott Gerring:** So in this case it's harmless. Because it ends up, I, randomness is one of those things where people take it very seriously, that something's truly random and whatnot. This is absolutely not truly random, but for the purposes of just random of picking an axis.\nAnd the axis should change a lot and look roughly random this would [00:09:00] work. But if you ran, there'll be some rust static analysis tools. You could run over rust programs to look for things that are unpleasant and most of them would fire off on the use of unsafe blocks like that. There is a massive code smell, but functionally, I don't think it's that terrible.\nIt's gonna kind of work, it's just creative and it's. Horribleness, \n[00:09:21] **Jason Hand:** maybe not the most efficient use of code. A senior person's gonna come in looking for ways to reduce lines of code.\n[00:09:27] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah. And they're also gonna be like, what were you thinking with this? I wasn't vibe that was bad for \n[00:09:35] **Jason Hand:** me.\n[00:09:35] **Scott Gerring:** It's just that it's so creative, to do it this way, it's not something that a human would really consider, I think. And I wonder if. It would be really interesting to see what caused it to not use the random number generated. 'cause there would absolutely be something like it. It tried to use it and it didn't work for Yeah.\nSome reason it's not obvious to me. And then it did this instead. \n[00:09:54] **Jason Hand:** That's an interesting point. It has caused us, you mostly now me, to pause [00:10:00] and think about the creativity of its response, and oh. You can, we can solve this problem in multiple ways. I guess we've always known that, but this is a different way.\nI've never seen, and I think at some level that has to unlock something in a person where they're like, whoa, yeah, I didn't know you could do that. Or I never thought to do it that way. You know what I mean? Like I'd live off those little mortals of, oh my God, I didn't know you do that, that it's it just keeps me moving forward.\nEven though you would never want to code like this, I think it's still a little bit of a learning revelation thing of we're just scratching the surface on stuff. \n[00:10:39] **Scott Gerring:** I absolutely, and I think it's very interesting, like it, it really makes me wonder how it's come to it, like what it's saying in the trading set or what error it encountered when it tried to do it with a random number generator that led to this.\nWhat you would expect to come outta the brain of an ordinary human programmer, which is why it really, it's really [00:11:00] jarring. But yeah I have another one that's, but would you call it \n[00:11:04] **Jason Hand:** slop? Because I think that's where that term comes \n[00:11:06] **Scott Gerring:** in. It's absolutely slop. Yeah. Okay. Because \n[00:11:09] **Jason Hand:** we look at images and video and it's just it gives you that WTF feeling where you're like, Ugh, what is this?\nYeah. That's the point of those things. At least the ones that end up on social media. This is not by design to be slop. It's just slop. And, but also it's creative, and I guess if you look at it through a squint through like an artist's view, it's creative. What are you gonna say?\n[00:11:33] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah. There's almost an aesthetic judgment in there, like I, you asked me if it was gonna work and I was like, yeah, it probably would, but it's disgusting. And that's me saying, I don't think this is good code. Based on prior exposure, but if it's gonna work, even if it's not truly random. \n[00:11:51] **Jason Hand:** Yeah.\n[00:11:52] **Scott Gerring:** Anyway, this one is interesting. In a similar way. It's also gross, but I think I can [00:12:00] explain how it's ended up at this and it's not enough to just see the snippet, to know what's going on, but basically in the Ray tracer, it built me this little progress bar on the bottom, so you, it is like a command line tool.\nYou run it. A little, a hash progress bar ticks across until it's done. And because they take hours to render, typically this is helpful to know that it's not just frozen. And I saw that and I was like, oh, that's cool. That's I like terminal stuff obviously, and this is really nice. It's great.\nAnd then while it was rendering the first time I cracked open my system monitoring stuff and I saw that it was spending like 95% of its time in the kernel. You can see like the split between user CPU time and Kernel CPU time. \nAnd the thing with normal ray traces is that they don't need to do anything with the outside world.\nThey just sit there in user space and do maths a lot until they're finished. They don't need to open file sockets, they don't need to use mu taxes, they don't need to load websites. So if you see that it's spending all this time going in and outta the kernel, then it's doing something that it shouldn't.\nYeah. So I saw that and the thing worked right? Like it [00:13:00] absolutely worked. It was just slow. But because Ray traces are also slow, it didn't really trigger me until I saw this CPU time split. So I saw that and I thought something terrible is happening in here and I wanna know what it is.\nAnd I dug around a bit and I found this. And the gist of it is that to make this little progress bar thing work, it needs to fan in from all these different worker threads that are doing rendering to one point to update a number that reflects the progress, right? If you have a million pixels in the image, you should bump it by one every pixel, and you can work out what percentage you are done.\nAnd it's done that by creating a single global mutex. So like a lock that one part of the program can hold at a time. And then every time a thread finishes rendering a single pixel, it has to lock that lock. And only one thing can hold the lock at once to increment a number by one. And the thing with that is, is that all of the threads, like you have a, I don't know, over 16 core CPUs, you probably have 32 actual threads.\nThey all spend most of the time blocked waiting [00:14:00] to hold this lock to bump a number by one. This is completely unnecessary, and it meant that the whole thing ended up spending like five times more Wow. Than it should have. \n[00:14:09] **Jason Hand:** It's \n[00:14:09] **Scott Gerring:** an expensive \n[00:14:10] **Jason Hand:** progress bar. \n[00:14:11] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah. It's crazy. And it's a funny failure mode because like I say, you don't notice it unless.\nYou, you dig into it a bit or you notice that the CPU usage is doing something funny or you have some mental model of roughly how slow it should be, which I didn't like I didn't realize that it was so much slower than what I remembered that I should look at, that it was only the CPU usage hint.\nBut the interesting thing here is I think you can see how it's got there. Rust has all these language elements that make it very hard to do things that are unsafe in kind of. Multi-processing situations. So if you have a bunch of threads and you have a piece of shared memory where you need to bump a number, for instance, you can't just share around immutable reference to this bit of memory.\nLike you can't do that in rust. It just won't let you. You can try and the compiler will just say, no, that is not allowed. Have you [00:15:00] considered using a mutex? So what I think has happened here is that it's tried to do it the naive way, which would work in other languages like Java or C or whatnot. The compiler has given it a very direct suggestion to use.\nTo use Aex and wrap it up in an arc, and then it's done it, and the thing's compiled and it's worked, so it's pretty happy. \n[00:15:20] **Jason Hand:** Do you recall, so this is all in . Claude Code. Just as a reminder that you're, that this code was generated. Do you recall which model it was using at the time?\nWas it sonnet? \n[00:15:29] **Scott Gerring:** It would've been, they just released a new one, I think, right? A week ago. I wanna \n[00:15:33] **Jason Hand:** say we, when we were chatting last, like when we recorded, I, it was probably 3.7 at the time. I think four came out just a little bit after that, but.\n[00:15:46] **Scott Gerring:** How do I do it? Model? \n[00:15:47] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. \n[00:15:48] **Scott Gerring:** So what do we have? SONET four. Yeah, it was three point something because I know came out. Yeah. \n[00:15:54] **Jason Hand:** I wanna say unless you've written, unless this code was generated within the last, like two weeks or so, or week and a [00:16:00] half, it's probably 3.7. Yeah. Okay. I've noticed differences with four.\nLike I've created some really interesting, I dunno, not super interesting, but surprisingly well built little demo apps in one or two shots. \n[00:16:17] **Scott Gerring:** Nice. \n[00:16:18] **Jason Hand:** With Claude Sonnet 4, and I can't put my finger on what's different about it, but I'm having a real high success rate. Cool. So I'd be curious to see what it did, what that model would do, \n[00:16:27] **Scott Gerring:** yeah, and this is a thing that I'm a bit sad about. We've talked about this before. I wish that. The tools themselves would write out a conversation log, because then you could just go back to it from a certain prompt, from just before when it did this, and you could say, you could just let it continue and see what happened.\nBut as it stands the production of the program, from the conversation I had with it is lost to the winds of time. Like it would be so hard to get it back into the situation to see if it was gonna do this little step here differently. \n[00:16:55] **Jason Hand:** Bringing that context through over time is a conversation we've had a few [00:17:00] times on here.\nRyan and I have chatted about it. Actually, Whitney on our team, I interviewed her last week, I wanna say two weeks ago maybe. She has been doing some work with MCP servers in Cursor and she's doing something that actually addresses exactly what you're talking about is after a session of coding.\nDuring the session of coding. And then of course anything has to be summarized afterwards. But during the like time you're coding and talking to Claude or whatever, all of that is getting captured into other. And into other files and being logged in a little bit more human readable way, not just like taking the logs from, whatever, output and console and throwing them in places, but like actually documenting what's been done, including prompts, all that kind of stuff.\nYeah, other people were thinking the same way as I worked, had so much success on. Day one, I need to bring everything that we did with me. Like whole thing needs to come with me, not just like the code. \n[00:17:55] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah. \nThere was there was a really interesting thing that I saw a few days ago.\nI'm [00:18:00] sure you saw it as well. CloudFlare published a project that they've built. I can't remember what it was exactly. It'll be something to do with network re or whatnot, something very cloud. The code was entirely built by Claude, as I recall. And they didn't just publish the code, they published all of the prompts that they used to get to the state of the code.\nSo it's a really interesting artifact 'cause it's like a big serious engineering company saying, Hey, we built this serious thing but we did it with generative ai and here's how I've been meaning to dig into it. 'cause I think it'd be very interesting. \n[00:18:30] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, I have not seen that. I'll have to look at that though.\n[00:18:32] **Scott Gerring:** Sounds I'll get through to you afterwards. \n[00:18:34] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, please do. \n[00:18:36] **Scott Gerring:** But yeah, so that one was interesting and this one here is terrifying in a. You, you were saying before, like if you saw that Rust that I showed you with the unsafe block, you wouldn't really think oh, this is terrible or whatnot, because you're not, you don't see yourself as a Rust programmer.\nYou don't have the sense for what might look unusual than Rust. Like I wouldn't have the sense for it in JavaScript, for instance, [00:19:00] this is more subtle than that. It's the same thing, but it's applied to the domain itself. So like the domain is a ray tracer, Ray tracing code has to look a certain way, do certain things.\nThis is missing something that's very important and you only know that it's missing if you've built a Ray tracer before and know what to expect here. And the gist of it is that like when you shoot array at a thing and it hits the thing, like this pencil and this glass that I handily have had handy it, it hits it and it either goes through it or it bounces off at absorbed.\nAnd if the ray trebles onwards, like if it goes through the glass and continues out the other side, you make a new ray based on how it bends through the glass. And what you need to do is make it so that the new ray starts. It doesn't have the start point at the intersection. It has to have, it has to be moved a tiny bit away from the surface along the direction of the outgoing.\nAnd the reason for that is that if you don't, because floating point maths is funny, some of the time it'll re intersect at the same point and you get weird artifacting in your output images. \n[00:19:59] **Jason Hand:** I think \n[00:19:59] **Scott Gerring:** there are probably [00:20:00] other ways of solving this, but like typically the thing to do is to just shift that new starting point of the new ray, a tiny bit along that outgoing redirection.\nOkay. And this just doesn't have that. So I saw the images, it was rendering, and I noticed that in particular for surfaces that were glass, it had this very particular artifacting in it. And I thought, okay, something unusual is happening here. And I found that it was missing that, but only because I know that it should be there.\nIf you weren't familiar with Ray tracing, you would probably just say, oh, it's just how it is, and it would be very difficult to work this out. So I think this is a heinous one because it. \n[00:20:37] **Jason Hand:** It sounds like this is a landmine that you've seen before, right? Like it's that knowledge that, that just comes up with experience, the wisdom of playing with Ray Traces.\nRay Trace. Yeah. Wisdom is a \n[00:20:47] **Scott Gerring:** strong word to use in this kind. It is.\n[00:20:49] **Jason Hand:** It's stuff that's not in the, it's not mentioned in the text, because you don't think about it. It's kinda an edge case almost. I think you \n[00:20:54] **Scott Gerring:** would, I think you would definitely see it mentioned.\nIt's a common pitfall. Yeah. But it's [00:21:00] just missed it. But I guess the point that I'm trying to make with it is that for something complex like this, or something reasonably complex, you have to understand what success looks like. Yeah. Before you let the agent rip on it, because at the end, if you can't assess whether or not it's correct or not, you have something that might be failing in a complicated way that you don't understand.\n[00:21:20] **Jason Hand:** Yep. \n[00:21:20] **Scott Gerring:** And I've really, I've picked a pathological case with this thing, right? Like you, you get an image out and the image can be broken in ways that are very subtle. It's not like a web service or something. Sure. So I appreciate that, but I still think that there's an important lesson in there about absolutely how far you can go away from what you fully understand.\n[00:21:37] **Jason Hand:** So what is it like just a couple lines of code that's missing or a function or one little variable with some math attached to it? How \n[00:21:45] **Scott Gerring:** much. A line, basically you would go new Ray I don't have all the context, but it'd be like new ray equals ray, new oldÂ startÂ point plus [00:22:00] times tiny spelling.\n[00:22:01] **Jason Hand:** Okay. So yeah, it's just got some basic hard coded math in there that you probably used to seeing. \n[00:22:06] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah. Yeah. You just you always have the direction and the direction will probably be like one, like a unit vector. Yeah. And you just make it really small 'cause you just wanna move it a tiny bit away so it doesn't re intersect itself.\n[00:22:15] **Jason Hand:** That makes sense. \n[00:22:16] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah. Okay. Cool. So some other stuff. And now for something different DevHub, have you had a look at DevHub yet? I haven't. \n[00:22:27] **Jason Hand:** I've been in there, but I haven't really spent like good, genuine time in there. \n[00:22:30] **Scott Gerring:** So I'll show you it really quickly and I will tell you what I've used Claude code for.\nSo this is something that we've been building in the advocacy team at Datadog recently to capture all of the integration points and extensibility information for Datadog, like highlight projects from the community that are building around the platform essentially. It's pretty cool. Go have a go, have a look at it.\nIf you've before everybody go check it out. It's pretty new. It's brand spaking new. Yeah. Yeah. We're very excited about where we can take it. But so the co the code part of this, the part of it that I spent [00:23:00] a bit of time on was a ETL pipeline, like extract, transform, load for all the different data sources we have about existing integrations for Datadog, so things like the agent extensions, third party libraries.\nWe have this data in various GitHub repos. And we wanted to put everything we already had straight into DevHub, which is this big job to get it all munged into a nice format, publish it out into the static website, build for DevHub itself. And this is something where Claude Code really shines because it's mapping, it's data mapping.\nLike it's what 99% of programming is. There's heaps of examples out of everywhere. You have sample data, you have a destination schema. So I had great success just using it to color in the lines for this. So for instance, for this one here, this is the schema for content items. That end up in DevHub and I got this.\nBasically by just giving [00:24:00] it the schema from Astro, so the website folks from Datadog built and Astro ui and the content catalog with static content in it with all the different fields they need for one side. And on the other side we have all of these data sources I mentioned, like the different agent integration data sets we have and library integration data sets.\nAnd I basically just put it all in files and gave it to Claude and said Hey, can you go and write me type definitions for this for TypeScript? And I did it and it was perfect, and it saved me a whole pile of time. Nice. \n[00:24:29] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. I love Astro as you mentioned, like our team's been kinda migrating some stuff over to Astro.\nWe just migrated our site. The AI tools Labs is now an Astro site. I just migrated my personal site to an Astros site as well. So yeah, it's a, it's the new hotness. It's fun. It's nice that the models do understand Astro pretty well, which is cool. \n[00:24:50] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah, and it works really well if you have a TypeScript thing that's producing the data and then you can TypeScript it up on Astro as well. My personal blog is also built with Astro and I also migrated it about a year [00:25:00] ago, and I. \n[00:25:02] **Jason Hand:** Seems like we've got a little Astro community, Starting to, you come together here. \n[00:25:06] **Scott Gerring:** It's, I think it's I don't have such strong opinions about web development, but it seems if you want something that works well and you don't have very strong opinions about web dev it is just perfect.\nI love it. \n[00:25:15] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. It's fast. It can shrink down like images and make your site faster and make some of that better. And just what's the word? Where there's like components you can drop things in.\nModular, perhaps. Modular. That's what I'm looking for. Yeah. Yeah. It's, I love it. \n[00:25:28] **Scott Gerring:** I like it a lot \n[00:25:28] **Jason Hand:** as well. Go check out Astro. \n[00:25:30] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah, everyone get Astro. Yeah. And so a similar sort of thing part of the import pipeline has all these libraries that we have. So if you go and build an integration to Datadog, to pull metrics from some particular system that exposes metrics, maybe a fancy hardware router device for instance.\nWe would link to a GitHub repository that contains the code for that. And as part of that, we wanna pull back a pile of metadata from GitHub, when it was it last updated, how many stars does it have, and so on. And for this, I needed a GitHub client. So I [00:26:00] gave Claude code, the API document link and said, go and write me a GitHub client, please.\nAnd again it just did it. It was great. I looked at the output. I couldn't fault it. It was, if anything better documented than what I would do myself. And I think things like this that really shines, like it's such a mechanical task. It's not something that needs. Heaps of brain capacity.\nIt's not something where there's heaps of variation within what you get out of it. It's just go forth and do it. And if you're limited by the speed of your typing, it takes a bit longer than if you're not. Yep. So I was really happy with that, and I find that it's also much, much better and more consistent with things like JavaScript and TypeScript with Rust, but I suspect that's just because there's a lot more of that in the training set.\nIt also works really well for refactoring TypeScript. I found that's something that I at least don't have a good IDE for, like I don't have something, for rust or for Java or whatnot. You have the jet brains tools. You wanna move things between packages, rename them. It's a couple of mouse clicks or some keystrokes.\nIt all works very [00:27:00] well. I find that you can just go to Claude and say, Hey, I'm not quite happy with this package layout. I would like to change it like this one. Do you think this is sensible? And two, go forth and do it for me. And it does it, it takes longer than if you have really fancy refactoring tools, but it's makes something that would otherwise be painful.\nVery easy. Yeah. \n[00:27:20] **Jason Hand:** Which I think is the perfect, like use case for a lot of these things. That's where I'm using Gene A Ai I the most is just make my life easier. Do the stuff I don't really, I know needs to be done. I know it'll make life and everything else easier moving forward, but it takes time to slog to get through it.\nYeah. \n[00:27:39] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah, and a lot of these things aren't actually fun. I think there's lots of elements of programming that are inherently very creative and it's a pity to offload that to a tool also because it helps you flesh out your model of the problem you're trying to solve if you do it yourself.\nBut heaps and heaps of programming is just boring, repetitive work. That these things really shine a\n[00:27:58] **Jason Hand:** hundred [00:28:00] percent. \n[00:28:01] **Scott Gerring:** This one's a bit harder to explain. I dunno if the text I've got is gonna be very interesting. So as part of this dev hub thing it's just transforming things between different data formats, like I mentioned.\nAnd for that you really want to have tests. You want some unit tests that are like, if I put this in to the machine that does the transforming, I get this out. I'm a sensible programmer, but I don't write JavaScript or TypeScript very much, and I'm not up, up to date with the latest tooling for all of that.\nSo it's can you go and write me a unit test so I can fill in the details myself? Delegating the scaffolding of the unit test to Claude. This was an absolute mess. I, and I think it's, like I say, I'm not a frontend person. It's it's really hard for me to judge how inherently hard the problem of hooking a unit test library up to a TypeScript no JS project is, but it went down this crazy rabbit hole.\nI dunno if I captured it here, where. It kept trying to change the module [00:29:00] packaging all over the place, and because DevHub is this nested multi module thing, it was changing it at different levels. I'll change this to ES Next and I'll change this to common JS and breaking everything in like really complicated, strange ways.\nBecause JavaScript module seems to be a very complicated thing, but in the end, the test, it had a test that ran, but like everything else was completely broken. So I looked at it and I was like, you've changed this thing that seems like it's probably a big deal. Can you tell me about that? And it explained itself, but I can't get myself into a situation where I'm comfortable with what it's done or I fully understand the implications of what it's done.\nSo I just gave up on it. I said, this is outside of my skillset and you haven't convinced me that it's within your skillset. But I found it really funny because it's like you give it a small task and it makes this dramatic project wide impacting choice without really telling you about it until you notice that everything else has been broken.\nBut yeah I think also if you were, you notice those ones quickly because you [00:30:00] go and look at the change set and all these files you weren't expecting to be touched have been touched. And then it's, the blast radius is naturally limited that way for sure. These two are a bit weirder.\nI'll explain this one quickly with my words because I don't think the text will help very much. Okay. I tried to clean it up a bit before, but I just confused myself. I just published this tool on our GitHub that does architectural unit testing for rust. So you can, there, there's similar tools for Java and DotNet you can write assertions about.\nIf. I have code in the rest API package, it shouldn't be using the database package directly. Or if I have code in the database package, it shouldn't have global static variables, stuff like that. Stuff that people have in their heads when they build systems, but you don't really have a way to encode them.\nBut the interesting fact about this from a generative AI perspective is that. To build things like this in the Rust-iverse, you have to use or you don't have to. But the easiest way to do it is to use the internals of rust itself. So like the compiler internals, [00:31:00] which you can do, but it's all very gnarly and not very documented, unsurprisingly.\nIt's also unstable. So I tried initially a bit when I started with Claude and with Cursor to let it work on this project. Hey, here's a lint that limits what things in this namespace can get to it in this other namespace. It just can't it tries, it runs into the wall. It can't get interfaces, right?\nIt doesn't understand the shape of the code or how to work with it. You just have to give up basically. I think this is reasonable as well though, because it's just, there's nothing about this anywhere. It's not something that's massively present in the training set. You can try and give it the source code of the Rust Compiler for the interfaces it's trying to use, but because these files are enormous, it'll immediately fill the whole context window and then some, and that doesn't really work either.\nI think maybe you could be really clever and strip out all the new lines and the comments and that and see if it could go with that. It's the only like truly pathological case I've [00:32:00] found so far, where the tools are just not helpful at all. \n[00:32:04] **Jason Hand:** When you are running Claude Code, you know how when you load Claude Code from whichever director you're in Claude Code has like an understanding of everything below that, right? So you can always sometimes I'll realize I need to go one more level up actually and give it more context. Of like the broader project. Did you run into anything like that or did you always start in like the most top tier place to load?\nClaude Code, \n[00:32:28] **Scott Gerring:** I often do it from a level down rather than a level up in the sense that there's a few projects I'm working on where they're like Monorepo microservice. So there's this surrounding context that has, infrastructure as code files deployment stuff for Readme, and then you have a bunch of sub-services.\nThen I find that if I start Claude Code in like the directory of a subservice and I'm working on something that's only relevant to the subservice it gets us confused. 'cause then it's just, you've basically said like this is the thing you are considering. But then, for anything cross [00:33:00] cutting, you get your claude.md in the top and you explain, here are all my different services.\nIf I ask you something about this then go look there. \nYeah, it, I think about that a lot. Like what you let it see initially really shapes its perception of the world. \n[00:33:14] **Jason Hand:** It really does. Yeah. And that and I think, whether you're trying to save token usage here and there, you make decisions on what context you end up giving it, which is gonna have a direct impact to the output.\n[00:33:26] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah.\nI think I am not nearly as frugal as I should be with the token usage stuff. Yeah. I, this is a bit the curse of having something like this bundled up from a nice subscription through your employer. I think it probably also has a performance issue though. Hey, if you run Claude Code, where it's always sitting on a hundred percent context window size, I assume that makes everything much slower, and that's my perception of it as well.\n[00:33:51] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. I feel like there has to be a push in, in the direction where rather than everybody in an organization [00:34:00] all like bringing down and pushing up and bringing down and pushing up context all the time, that somehow all of us are just sharing the same context. Yeah. You know what I mean? Because we're just we're just wasting passing data back and forth.\nIt usually all sits in. In the place it always needs to be, I think, but getting it into the models, of course sending it into wherever you're sending it is the expensive part, but I feel like we, that's a problem we're gonna have to solve for because code's not getting code, bases aren't getting necessarily smaller.\n[00:34:31] **Scott Gerring:** There's lots of interesting kind of intermediate representations for query and code these days. Code QL is one where, you run it over your code base and it builds a little embedded database that kind of describes the structure of it. Syntax tree style, but abstracted a bit back from the concrete language.\nI wonder if things are gonna go in that direction rather than just jamming enormous strings into context everywhere. Being a bit fancier. Yeah, you're right. There's a lot of rediscovery effects about code just because the tools tend to [00:35:00] work primarily with big string buffers. Yeah. It seems like there's a lot of reasonably low hanging fruit there to push things in the right direction.\n[00:35:10] **Jason Hand:** MCP is a good example of, I think us all just solving the problems that we continue to, bump into. It's oh, now we need some other way to interface with all these other tools and so not us Anthropic people much smarter than me. I'm just a, I'm just a beneficiary. But , there's gonna be more of that, right?\nI just think we're gonna continue finding ways around the roadblocks that we hit. \n[00:35:30] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah, absolutely. And I think MCP also for us in the Datadog sense is really interesting because you can imagine some really cool use cases for it. For instance you, you have the situation where you have Cursor open and a unit test broken, you say.\nYou can see the broken unit test, go and fix it. With MCP, you could say, Hey, you can see this production issue. You have all this different observability data about it. Go and fix it. I think that's really cool. I haven't had much time to play with it yet, but like it could be [00:36:00] one of those things that feels very akin to magic when it works well.\n[00:36:04] **Jason Hand:** Yeah. All right. \n[00:36:06] **Scott Gerring:** Cool. Anything else you wanna share before we wrap things up? The absolute last one I have, and this isn't very interesting in comparison to the code ones, I think, is, I have this fancy writing tablet. I dunno if you have one of these. Okay. It's a SuperNote, but it's like an ola sorry, a okay.\nE ink thing you can write on. And I use it constantly now because it's I dunno. I like the tactility of it or something, but it's, yeah I write a lot for work, obviously, and I've taken to writing on this rather than typing so I can go sit outside in the hammock or whatnot and just write a little bit hammock driven development style.\nOkay. And what I've taken to doing with it is exporting the thing I've written as a PDF and giving it to either Claude code or chat GPT. As well as the context of say, my existing blog writing and saying, Hey, can you go and transcribe all of this, fix all the spelling mistakes Australian English spelling.\nThank you very much. And if anything is weird or [00:37:00] stylistically unusual about it, highlight it for me. And that works really well. It saves so much time and it fixes, like in, in the old days where you would just do. Like handwriting recognition. It fixes all of the weird little issues because your handwriting's awful, or you can't spell properly or whatnot.\nThat's awesome. It almost feels like a boring use case in comparison to everything else, oh, \n[00:37:19] **Jason Hand:** That's a, I love that. I've got something similar. I've got I forget what it's called but a little tablet that I can write on also and export PDFs out. So yeah, you might have to gimme more details on step by step what you're doing there.\nI'll try it with my stuff too \n[00:37:33] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah, absolutely. But it's so simple and unexciting, but it's just, it just works. It makes my life, I think anything that solves \n[00:37:38] **Jason Hand:** little problems for me is some of the most exciting stuff. \n[00:37:41] **Scott Gerring:** Yeah. Fair enough.\n[00:37:45] **Jason Hand:** Cool. Scott, this has been awesome. Thanks for giving us a little bit of an update on additional findings that you've come across as you experiment with Claude Code.\nI think a lot of what you have is [00:38:00] so unique to Rust which is nice. I don't get a lot of exposure to Rust, so it's good to hear some just what you're seeing and learning as you start to experiment. So I can add that to my own knowledge. I think \n[00:38:12] **Scott Gerring:** it's also, it works comparatively very well for things like TypeScript.\nSo the weird things that I like to talk about tend to be more in rust. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Anyway, it's been a pleasure as always. Yeah. \n[00:38:23] **Jason Hand:** Thanks for thanks for getting on and talking to me and yeah, hopefully we'll do it again sometime in the near future. \n[00:38:29] **Scott Gerring:** Absolutely.
